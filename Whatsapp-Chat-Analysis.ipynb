      "\n",
      "Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n",
      "08/06/20, 20:13 - Anuj Gupta: I  would strongly disagree with this statement. We realise that definitely, today's youth is tending to live its life their own way and they somehow, have a strong disconnect with the traditional practices which are being followed world over. They donot stick to a healthy lifestyle and donot have a healthy diet. However, they are still more health conscious. They have a strong eye on the health parameters and if someone has a health issue, he or she is more prompt to approach a doctor. The people in today's time donot follow the instructions given to them by their elders in the family immediately and their counter these advises. However, they apply their intelligence, logics and then do research on the problems and then take action. Today's youth is more prompt in approaching diagnostic centers and get their tests done without doctor's advise. They would rather take the report to the doctor and then seek a treatment. You know why? They are more confident about themselves rather than listening to elders and believing the God that everything will be alright. They trust their actions and not beliefs of others. Knowledge is a bliss. Trust is a power. Absence of one of these lead to problems. Today's youth is full of these and tend to grow continuously on these fronts. Earlier , people used to have more fears about health and they used to stick to particular life styles, but they never analysed the causes of health problems when these occurred. They just put tot the God to take care of them. Some problems were cured by doctors, some went on their own and remaining, they had to face the consequences. So, all these reasons imply that average standard of the health will be better in the future than it is now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would cite a live example from my life. My son was diagnosed recently with a kidney stone. He suffered huge pains and we were literally helpless. We could not go out to doctors due to Corona fears. We tried various things viz. giving homeopathic medicines, excessive water for drinking etc. , but nothing worked. Then took medication from a Urologist and that did the things. Now, when we finally analysed the entire sequence of events, we realised that our son suffered from this because of this attitude. He never drank plenty of water. Whenever, we told him to do so, he ignored. We blamed him all the time for his habits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he asked me a question as to why I could not guide him properly to follow a healthy lifestyle. He could drink water only when he felt need for it. He suffered from pain but he had the capacity to bear it and developed a faith in himself that he would be alright soon. He took medicines and continued to spend his time thinking that things would be alright. Also, he studied about the stones in this time on internet and figured out various things which could help him in future to avoid their re-occurrence. All it was about his trust and faith in his knowledge which he gained during this crisis. HE emerged stronger as a person. Instead of cursing God and his habits, he analysed the sequences and devised strategies to live his life in a more healthy way.\n",

      "12/06/20, 11:12 - Anuj Gupta: What is inner self? Ha e we analysed ever as to why that small child inside us or that trait inside us is affected at times by happenings around? At times, things happen - some are real and some are just interactions, some are confrontations and some are illusions. Why do moods swing?\n",
      "We talk of connections of souls. What rips apart the bonds. Why are relationships so fragile? If there are internal bonds, why external factors suddenly come in and start dominating???\n",
      "12/06/20, 11:20 - Anuj Gupta: I think 🤔 there is lack of trait to take a stop over and go over the things again and then make a decision at times. Sudden response to a situation is called reaction and that 90% of us do. Rethinking and understanding the things is analysis. Taking the correct action in the base of analysis is called action !!!\n",
      "How we Newton said that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. \n",
      "So there will be reactions. But to handle reactions. If there is no reaction, that violates nature’s laws. Reaction gives a room of thoughts as to understand the gravity of things. What is good, what is bad, how to read human psyche- this is inferred.\n",
      "Question arises again. Action and reaction are fine but where is that bond which binds us?\n",
      "Fragility means weak bond or is it just an illusion?\n",
      "12/06/20, 11:28 - Anuj Gupta: The whole ecosystem is about happenings, developments, results, thought processes, strategies etc. But why does one become so mechanical? We tend to do, do and redo the things. But do we ever or many times apply intellect to look at other side of things? To one , certain things may mean some things in the world. But to another one, some things might mean the entire world.  To some, entire world might not mean anything at all!\n",
      "So there is a diversity of people, thoughts, psychologies, values, perceptions. What does anything stop anyone from understanding one core of life?\n",
      "\n",
      "Life is all about doing good things, live happily, spread happiness. We strive entire life to earn big things but how many times, we really analyse as to have we lived the way as if we have never lived. We just breathed and had food and did things etc etc.\n",
      "12/06/20, 11:32 - Anuj Gupta: Values, values and values!!!!\n",
      "Which Goddamn value we talk and believe? Have we ever analysed. These values change every moment. Parameters change but what about our inner self, our beliefs, our definitions. They keep getting influenced one way or the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Retrospection, retrospection, retrospection!!!!!!!!!\n",

It is a very beautiful poem and here we have talked about the beauty of nature describing the sky , the birds , the rivers , the sun and the entire life cycle . it is a beautiful experience and I have tried to convert this into a drawing. I had a unique feeling translating this poem into a drawing because with every photo which I drew, I felt as if I was becoming a part of the ecosystem and I could feel the warmth of the nature and it's magic. I could feel as if I was standing in the middle of this picture and watching the things happening in front of me. I felt complete and got lot of positivity and above all a wonderful experience. I am thankful to the almighty to shower us with his blessings in the form of such a beautiful nature. Thank you\n",

Values refer to our ethics which mean our perceptions driven by our core inner conscience which tells us as to what is right for us in terms of actions and reactions. Values play an integral part in our life. Without values, we are just living creatures who breathe, eat and do things to live life but we tend to live as if we have never lived life as a human , just a living creature. We need values to keep our self esteem high, equip ourselves with a sense of responsibilities, build relationships and live them with love, affection and dedication. Our values drive us to understand and perform our roles towards our family, society, country and humanity.\n",

In the meeting called by you on 15.03.2021 in the Community Centre, it was apprised that in the wake of hike in prices of cement and steel, project cost may go up approximately by 10%.  Going by that, the estimated price could have been around Rs.20 Crores and not 25 Crores.  \n",

      "11/11/21, 00:07 - Anuj Gupta: For the first time in many years, I realised the meaning of true friendship. It was the tragic time period of the month of May when the Covid 2nd wave was on the peak. There was a lot of tension in my house. With God's grace, we were all doing fine but the situation was not the same with our relations. My mother fell ill with some stomach infection and father was over occupied with the business work and managing the household affairs. We really needed someone to help us out in this tough time. My grandmother who doesn't do much of the work at home also refused to cooperate. Now, the only option was to get a maid at home to do household work and prepare the meals for us. It was not safe due to the Covid scare and moreover, we were not in favor. \n",
      "I was crying one day and my friend Saanvi saw me. She came to me and asked about things. I could not hold my tears and explained the scenario of things. Saanvi told me that she would help me. She discussed the issue with her mother. She called up Mom and understood her situation. From that day and for the next one week, Saanvi's mother prepared the food for the entire entire family twice a day and sent it in tiffins to us. We tried telling them not to do it but still they did it. Not only this, they sent tea and coffee too for all. We were all overwhelmed with this gesture. \n",
      "It was a wonderful experience and for the first time, I realised the true meaning of friendship. Saanvi is so dear to me and we have been friends for the past 5 years. She always used to tell me that one day she would do something great for me. The days had come. She proved it. My mother recovered. She is doing fine now. I am so grateful to my true friend. She made this saying true - A friend in need is a friend indeed. \n",
      "Not only this, her mother came to my house too once and asked for the well being of all. At times, when people were keeping to themselves, they came up and helped us. God bless them. Full of gratitude for them.\n",

      "\n",
      "Covid 19 has changed the lives of the people across the globe. It has had a huge impact on the entire ecosystem, thereby, impacting the economy, social and cultural life and also various other aspects of human mankind. While human life has changed all over, the state of physical and mental health of people has raised enormous concerns and is now a big center of focus with a lot of work around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let us give some thoughts to the subject of our ethics and responsibilities as being responsible citizens and social beings. There is a famous saying that the charity begins at home. The first lesson of life is taught at home. The first successful assignment where one delivers required results is carried out at home only. So, when we talk about social work values and ethics in this Covid era, we need to first understand what we are supposed to do first when the discussion is focussed on this mega topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "To err is a human and a human is a social being. We live in an environment where we are surrounded by people, connected to each other through personal or social or business relationships. This ecosystem is called society and thus, each one of us is driven by social values and ethics. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our objective is to understand as to what are we required to follow or deliver in a scenario which is driven by the Pandemic impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our first step towards delivering our responsibilities is to understand what are the DOs and DON'Ts. Are we taking care of these points? Can we keep others healthy if we ourselves are not healthy? Certainly, if we have a disease which can spread, we can contaminate the environment and others can get that too. So, here is the basic ethic to be followed first of all. Wear masks while you are in public. Your safety is primary and that will keep others safe too. If somebody does not wear a mask, ask the person to do so and do not support someone who is not doing so. Do not ever indulge into public interaction without following this protocol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, is to ensure that you get vaccinated. Also, motivate /educate others too to do so. There is a famous saying - Each one teaches one. So follow this and cultivate this chain of vaccinated people. \n",
      "\n",
      "Prevention is always better than cure. What is it that we can do to have a healthy environment. The answer is to have healthy people around. Let us increase the awareness to follow methods to stay healthy. Let us make physical exercise and Yoga a regular part of life. These will increase the immunity and less chances of contracting the infection. As a responsible and caring society member, we should focus on these and guide at least our own family members to follow these.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of people who have suffered from this disease. Many of them recovered. Many lost lives. Many lost their near and dear ones. Think of the mental agony which these people have passed through. Our values tell us that we should support them to whatever extent we can. Give them mental support at least. If possible, provide financial assistance too to the needy ones if feasible. If you are a business service provider, provide goods/services at economical prices to the people who cannot pay much. If you are an employer, ensure that you do not lay off people as currently the economy is affected and there are not many jobs in the market. So, do not snatch somebody's bread. If you are a medical practitioner, ensure that you do not work to charge more money from the patients. Try to provide best treatments and if possible, give concessions to people who cannot pay much. Same for the hospital owners and diagnostic centers.\n",
      "\n",
      "A lot of people have been working from home during this pandemic. There have been situations where families are happy to have their dear ones in front of their eyes at home and working. People have developed better understanding. But there have been other things too. The friction has increased in the family members and relationships are affected thereby resulting in deterioration of their emotional bonding. The pandemic has seen splits in the families just because of the people not valuing the safe being of their dear ones as they have been working from home and are in front of their eyes. Our values state that we need to value people and respect their dignity and give them due respect which they deserve. Everyone plays a vital role in the family and no one is more or less important.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very important to be a responsible citizen of the country. Our ethics tell us that we should follow the protocols. We should pay taxes on time. Covid has put an immense burden on the Government and they have been doing a lot of work. We should support wherever we can to the best. \n",
      "\n",
      "We should promote a green environment. Try to control pollution. Use electric vehicles as much as possible. While the majority of the population uses petrol and diesel vehicles, we should ensure that our vehicles do not emit pollution. Get these serviced regularly. Ensure that you have a valid pollution control certificate for the vehicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, overall, our focus should be to build an environment around us where we can stay healthy, keep others healthy, be happy and keep others happy, eat well, sleep well and let others do so. So, the time is now to consider the whole planet as a family, our society. AND, another important thing, cultivate greenery. Plant trees. If not trees, at least have plants at home. Breathe fresh air. Eat vegetarian food, healthy food. Stop drinking alcohol and educate others too. Have positive thoughts and spread positive vibes in people. Have faith in God and spread positivity around.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, life comes only once. Live it to the fullest, to the best and to the best of your cultural and social values with high morale and ethics. Good Day!\n",

      "2. *You can't destroy* the COVID19 viruses that have penetrated cell walls by drinking gallons of hot water -  *you're just going* to the bathroom more often.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. *Washing your hands is the best method* for your protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. If you *do not have* a COVID19 patient at home, there is *no need* to disinfect your home surfaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Packed cargoes, gas pumps, shopping carts and ATMs do not cause infection.  *Wash your hands*, live your life as usual.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. COVID19 *is not a foodborne* infection. It is associated with *infection drops* like the flu. There is *no* demonstrated risk that COVID19 is *transmitted* through food.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. You *can* lose your sense of smell with many allergies and viral infections. This is *just* a non-specific *symptom* of COVID19.\n",

      "9. The COVID19 virus *is not* in the air. This is a respiratory droplet infection that requires *close contact*.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. The air is clean, you *can walk* through the gardens, through the parks, just *avoid crowding*.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. It is sufficient to use *normal soap* against COVID19, not antibacterial soap. This is a *virus, not a bacteria*.\n",

      "COVID19 *home with the *shoes* is *like being struck* by lightning twice a day. I've been working against viruses for 20 years -  *infections* by droplets do *not* spread like that!\n",

      "14. You *cannot* be protected from the virus by drinking vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger! These *are for immunity*, not healing.\n",

      "15. Wearing a mask for long periods *interferes* with *breathing and oxygen levels*.   *Only* use it in a crowd.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "17. *Immunity* is greatly weakened by *always remaining* in a sterile environment. Even if you eat immunity-boosting foods, *regularly leave your house* for any park/beach. *Immunity is increased* by exposure to pathogens, not by staying home and consuming fried/spicy/sweetened foods and carbonated beverages, and not engaging in physical activity.\n",

      "05/05/22, 22:16 - Anuj Gupta: The summer of 2021, a very different season that year. This year was completely different and brought a lot of painful memories in life. We saw things, came across experiences which we had not felt ever in our entire life time. It was the beginning of April and that was the time when I had a feeling of slight respite that life had begun to stabilize after going through that nightmare of Covid era which had hit the world last year in March 2020. \n",
      "\n",
      "People had almost given up using masks and life seemed to be going on at a normal pace and everyone had a thought that Covid was gone and we could actually forget it like another pandemic which was successfully addressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Destiny had something else in store for everyone!!!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "The month of April began and the weather as usual had started becoming hot, temperature rising and everyone thought that this summer will again be like the one which was there 2 years back. Things started changing abruptly and we started seeing a spike in the number of Covid cases. Cases started increasing suddenly and the numbers began to multiply everyday. The 2nd wave of Covid was in. All of a sudden, life changed again. Lockdown was declared and the educational institutes were closed. Companies once again implemented Work from Home but everything seemed to get into the place a bit late. The 2nd wave had crippled the lives of people and a large number of people had contracted the delta virus which was the new strain, a really deadly strain. \n",
      "\n",
      "There was hue and cry everywhere , scarcity of oxygen cylinders, shortage of beds in the hospitals, shortage of medicines for treating people and the situation became worse and the Pandemic got fierce. Being in a business family, we were completely dependent on the traditional way of running the business which was characterized   by direct sales and one to one interaction with the clients. There were huge losses but somehow we managed to cover up our expenses and got going with things.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, somebody in the house was contacted with the virus and our Uncle who was staying with us in our house at that time got severely ill. He was found to be delta positive. We had a huge panic at home and everyone was grief stricken. We somehow worked to maintain social distance and started the treatment for Uncle. Everyone else got quarantined and we somehow got alright after 3 days of fever. We took plenty of hot water and vitamins , did yoga and became alright. \n",
      "\n",
      "Medical situation became severe and his oxygen level went down. It was a critical situation and there were no beds available anywhere. We didn't know what to do and where to go. Nothing was working for him. This was a time when we actually realised the hardship of life. We used to get phone calls everyday from relatives and friends and they asked for well being but nobody had any solution. We realised that nobody could do anything and it was all up to the Almighty. Then an Angel appeared on the scene. We had a neighbour who stayed 5 houses away from us. To the best of our surprise, he is a person with whom we hardly had any interaction and he was new in the area. One day, my mother was going to the temple and he suddenly asked who everyone was at home and he had not seen anyone in the vicinity since a week. Mother started weeping and narrated the whole hardship the family faced. And now, it was a new chapter of life which began.\n",
      "\n",
      "That Uncle visited our place and assured his best help. He brought lunch and dinner for everyone in the house and carried on for the next one week. He was working in a Pharma company and he arranged a nurse and doctor who visited our house and provided oxygen arrangement to Uncle who was ill. The doctor started treating Uncle and his oxygen level started stabilising. The medicines started working and it was a real miracle that took place. His family took care of so well and arranged food, medicines , treatment and every essentials and things improved. Uncle was out of danger and health was okay. He had recovered. Everyone at home had a sigh of relief and everyone was also doing fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "This person had come like an angel and soon we realised that the faith we had in Almighty was really a Universal Truth. God helped us in his form as he became his angel. I wonder at times as to what was his interest in doing all this. Instead he put his life at risk but he had only one agenda - to be a human and extend the best of this help. He lived to his values and did what he thought was right. Do good and help others. No objective of earning any money and only thought was to be a good human. Do we really have such angels in today's materialistic world? It is amazing. All We feel and pray to God is to bless him with all the health, wealth and happiness in his life. The time of this month of April and May was terrible and many members in the family might have struggled to survive but destiny had something else in store for us. Our good deeds paid, our faith in God paid and we came out of that nightmare. \n",
      "\n",
      "Life was restored back to normal. Time changed. Business improved. Health improved. But still today when I think about those days, I am not able to believe how we can have such angels among us in today's materialistic world. \n",
      "\n",
      "We all at times boast of our relations, our money, our contacts , our influence. Where does all that go when you actually need help in tough situations? There is a famous saying that as and when a ship starts drowning, at first the rats run away from the ship. So, when we are in trouble, is it a fact that the so-called best of the relatives shut their doors first. Are they friends in need or are they friends in good times and just neighbors in bad times who don't open their doors.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is how this world is. People call up just to let the other person know as to what great they have done in their lives. Who bothers to actually ask someone if they need help any time. Rather they tend to step away when there is a need. So, very few people in this world understand the meaning of real humanity and they come to rescue when someone actually needs it. \n",
      "\n",
      "That Uncle did this for us. We shall always be grateful to him for what all he did to us. May God bless him with all prosperity in life.\n",

      "Just because I am holding a senior position in HR with L&T, I have been getting many requests from my relatives, friends,  acquaintances, to help their sons or daughters, who have freshly passed out from engineering college, to get job in L&T. The number of requests are huge. So many fresh engineers are unemployed, I could hardly helped only few of them to get job in L&T or in some other companies where I have contacts. I feel bad to say NO to many of the requests or for those whom I can't help. They get disappointed... I can understand. Parents invest their life time earned money just to see their sons or daughters getting degree in engineering.\n",
      "\n",
      "They think that jobs are easily available for engineers. After interviewing many of them, I can't even tell them  that your son or daughter do not even have minimum required technical knowledge. Getting first class or distinction has become so easy without having fundamental knowledge of engineering. *It's high time for parents to stop running behind engineering degrees.*\n",

      "*USA produces around 1 lakh engineers per year for a $16 trillion economy.*\n",
      "*India produces 15 lakhs engineers for a $2 trillion economy.* \n",
      "The earlier mass recruiting sector was Manufacturing. It used to recruit from the core branches like Electrical, Mechanical, Civil etc. But, Manufacturing is relatively stagnant at 17% of the GDP. So the core branch placements have become very difficult. \n",
      "The more recent mass recruiter was the IT sector. It grew from scratch to almost 5% of the GDP in a short time. IT Employed millions of engineers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, IT is also saturating. Only good, skilled IT Engineers are in demand. \n",
      "If you look at the sectoral composition of Indian economy, most of the sectors do not need engineers. Tourism is 10% of the GDP, does not require engineers. Financial sector, Trade, Hotels and Restaurants do not require engineers. Requirement of engineers in Health, Education, Agriculture is also negligible. \n",
      "\n",
      "*More than 50% of the GDP has no role for Engineers.* Still most of Indian youth are becoming Engineers. The situation is not sustainable . \n",
      "Demand is low while supply is high. Over and above this, skill level of an average engineer is poor, almost its non-existent in many cases. If we leave aside the top 100–200 colleges, most fresh engineers have no idea of what they studied. Ask a fresh mechanical engineer, can s/he design a simple frame? \n",
      "\n",
      "Today the situation is that most engineers are working in a field that has no connection to what they have studied in the college. This is a waste of resources. \n",
      "Engineering degree does not come cheap. It costs about 10-15 lakhs. For poor parents, its a huge burden. When their son / daughter is not able to secure a job, they are devastated. \n",
      "\n",
      "For the nation, you can calculate the loss. Leave around 1 lakh engineers that NASSCOM says are employable. The rest 14 lakhs have each wasted 10 lakhs of fees. That totals to around $20 Billion. Almost equal to the Government’s spending on healthcare. Over this, there is loss of human capital. \n",
      "India needs to replan the whole engineering education system. Goverment need to  cut down on the number of colleges and improve the quality in the rest. \n",
      "\n",

      "For a majority of courses like these, there are entrance exams too, such as the NATA, CEED, NID entrance, NIFT entrance, NDA entrance, MBA Entrance, Hotel Management entrance, CET, NEET and many more! Here, the right training goes a long way in getting your child admission to their dream institute! *Do you know what are the top career tracks of 2022 other than engineering??* See the following list.\n",

      "\n",
      "However, before I consider answering this great question, let us do some retrospection of the events and developments/ trends of the past few decades.\n",
      " \n",
      "India is a land of diversity. We have a population of nearly 1.7 billion and have people living in villages and towns, with different mindsets, different cultures, educational backgrounds, \n",
      "different religions, different philosophies etc. So, the lives of people are characterized with different challenges and different approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, when talking of changing something in such a big demographic, we need to consider the impact of bringing the change. Are people susceptible to change? Is change going to be smooth ?\n",
      "Every change may have some goal but the results may not be aligned to the desired outcomes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think, with all said above, the focus areas change could be Education system, Medical Ecosystem, Infrastructure, Economy, Technology Trends.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to focus on the Education system, Medical Ecosystem and another subject which explains how to live our lives with leisure and satisfaction. In other words, how to take the best out of \n",
      "whatever we do.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the first subject : Education System!\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very generic topic and I guess, almost everyone will have diversified thoughts on this. I would like to emphasize that when I say this topic, I am not talking of the way admissions are made in colleges or the courses are structured or how the fee is decided for the courses. My concern is as to how we develop quality and skilled professionals who can be efficient and responsible citizens of the country \n",
      "and can help the human mankind in solving the complex problems which could be from the daily life, business world, medical science or engineering etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, let us analyze a bit. When a student enrolls in a school or college, what is their goal? They are taught only one thing in school - get good marks and try to achieve number one position. also, they are \n",
      "motivated to focus on their health too. When one joins a college - their goal is to get a good job or enrol in a good degree in higher studies and make money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can we think something beyond this. Is earning money the only goal of life? \n",
      "\n",
      "Have we ever thought about what we should be doing? We live in a family. We are answerable to our family and have responsibilities. Then we have responsibilities towards our society, our country and then the entire humanity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Should we not be explained right from day one as when we join our school or college that we should identify one goal of our life? We should be made to analyze what it is that we can do the best?\n",
      "Which are the complex problems around us that we can solve and accordingly work? Should we not be made to understand that we need not run after money. If we have value in our work, money will\n",
      "itself come to us.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead what we are explained to do - WE ALL SERVE OR MADE TO DREAM TO SERVE A VERY SMALL SEGMENT OF THE SOCIETY WHO JUST USE OUR SKILLS AND MAKE MONEY AND IN\n",
      "RETURN PAY US SOME PART OF IT!!!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "I would like to add to the education system a lot more practical study of the environment. Everybody should be educated in a way that one understands how to solve problems and not create problems\n",
      "for someone to solve. We need to learn how to do things ourselves , instead of depending on others for everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does current education teach us or train us as to how we can follow protocols in our daily life?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tell me why we do not use a helmet while driving a two wheeler or when we are sitting with someone on it? Why can't we use masks in Covid Era? Why do we tend to overspeed and reach early?\n",
      "How many of us remember this - BETTER LATE THAN NEVER! There would be numerous examples from all walks of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Have we ever focussed on the fact that our body needs healthy food and what do we eat??? Do we ever think of keeping our health in good condition?\n",
      "\n",
      "So, I would like to bring about this change in Education system. LET EDUCATION TEACH US HOW TO LIVE A SIMPLE, DISCIPLINED AND HEALTHY LIFE AND MAKE US MATURE TO REALIZE \n",
      "WHAT COULD BE THE BEST SUBJECT FOR US WHERE WE CAN BUILD A CAREER AND THAT WOULD HELP US AND EVERY ONE!\n",

      "We are very intelligent to remember the medicines, identify the best specialists but how many of us work to improve our health?\n",

      "Should we not have a centralized system where everyone is registered through a unique ID and a health record is maintained.

This all can be managed using Data Science and AI.\n",

      "\n",
      "आज एक वीडियो देखा, उसमे 2 नवयुवक car में बैठे हैं, तभी एक लड़का उनकी car का windscreen साफ करने आता है... वो bonut पर चढ़ जाता है, फिर हाथ में पहनी हुई घड़ी दिखाता है.. इतने में एक लड़का शोर मचाने लगता है... पकड़ो पकड़ो.\n",
      "\n",
      "वो बच्चे को नहीं पकड़ पाते... बाद में ड्राइव कर रहा युवक बताता है कि ये नया scam है, जिसमें एक gang छोटे बच्चो को High Tech घड़िया दे देता है.. फिर वो बच्चे आपकी car कि सफाई करने का बहाना मार कर आपके fasttag को अपनी घड़ी से scan कर लेते हैं.. और आपका wallet खाली हो जाता है.\n",
      "\n",
      "Social media की मेहरबानी से ये वीडियो पूरी दुनिया में वायरल हो रहा है... लोग बिना जानकारी इसे फैला रहे हैं.. और बेवजह डर रहे हैं.\n",
      "\n",
      "इसका एक ही शब्द में अगर सच जानना है... तो वो यह है की ये वीडियो 'Fake' बनाया हुआ है... ऐसा कोई FastTag scam नहीं होता.\n",
      "\n",
      "अब आप पूछेंगे कि ऐसा कैसे???\n",
      "\n",
      "पहले आप Technology को समझिये.\n",
      "\n",
      "आपकी गाड़ी में एक FastTag लगा होता है... उसमे एक छोटी सी  RFID Chip होती है, एक antenna होता है.... बहुत छोटा होता है... Tag की दोनों layers के बीच में होता है. इस chip में आपकी गाड़ी की जानकारी होती है... और Backend से आपका NHAI wallet, Paytm Wallet या आपकी Bank के account की जानकारी इसमें Coded होती है.\n",
      "\n",
      "दूसरे छोर पर होता है NHAI.... जो आपसे Toll वसूलता है... हर टोलप्लाजा पर एक scanner होता है.. जो आपके गाड़ी के FastTag को स्कैन करके Payment वसूलता है. जाहिर है Payment NHAI के bank account में ही जायेगा...... इसका अर्थ है Background में NHAI का बैंक account Connect होता है... जो भी पैसा कटेगा वो सीधा NHAI के account में ही जायेगा... अड़ोस पड़ोस वाले किसी अंकल के account में नहीं जा सकता... क्यूंकि इसकी programming ही ऐसे हुई है.\n",
      "\n",
      "FastTag से पैसा कैसे Deduct होता है??\n",
      "आपकी car में जो FastTag RFID chip होती है.. वो एक Passive Chip होती है... मतलब उसमे कोई Power source या Battery नहीं connect होती.....जैसे ही आप अपनी car को Toll Plaza पर लगे हुए Scanner के एक ख़ास Radius में लाते हैं... वो scanner आपके RFID पर signal डालता है... और आपका RFID सारी जानकारी Scanner को Transmit कर देता है..... और जितने पैसे कटने होते हैं.. वो Signal आपकी बैंक account या wallet को चला जाता है.\n",
      "\n",
      "आपके Wallet या Account से NHAI को payment कैसे जाता है??\n",
      "\n",
      "Backend में NCPI का जबरदस्त  इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर काम करता है.... वही आपके account की जानकारी रखता है... और जैसे ही टोलप्लाजा का Scanner Fasttag को read करता है... अगर Tag सही है, Blacklist नहीं है.. उसमे Balance है.. तो वो NCPI को instruction दे देता है... कि ग्राहक के account से इतनी रकम काटो....\n",
      "\n",
      "Background में NCPI का UPI या बैंकिंग payment system उतनी रकम आपके Wallet या Account से NHAI के account में transfer कर देता है.\n",
      "\n",
      "और थोड़ी देर में आपको msg भी आता है... कि NHAI के इस Highway के Toll से आपके इतने रूपए कटे, और इतना balance बचा है.\n",
      "\n",
      "अब आप सोचिये.... जब आपका RFID coded है, उसे टोलप्लाजा पर लगे scanner के अलावा कोई डिवाइस पढ़ नहीं सकती....... उधर Scanner पर NHAI का account नंबर ही Fixed हो रखा है..... मतलब जो भी पैसा जायेगा वो NHAI के account में ही जायेगा..\n",
      "\n",
      "ऐसे में कोई बच्चा, पालिका बाजार मे 50 रूपए की 2 दर्जन मिलने वाली फर्जी घड़ी पहन कर.. आपकी गाड़ी के bonut पर Locking Popping करके scan करके आपके account से पैसा उड़ा लेगा?? मतलब आपके हिसाब से यह संभव है 😂😂😂\n",
      "\n",
      "और अगर यह इतना ही आसान है... तो कोई भी parking में खड़ी गाड़ियों से ना कर लेगा scan???  सुबह से शाम तक पालिका बाजार या खान मार्केट की parking में scan करो.. शाम तक करोड़पति बन जाओ.... बढ़िया स्कीम है भाई लोग 😂😂\n",
      "\n",
      "इसलिए कहा गया है... दिखावो पर मत जाओ.. अपनी अक्ल लगाओ..... वैसे वो वीडियो बनाने वाले पर सुना है FIR हो गयी है.... पुलिस जल्दी ही उसका FastTag सुजायेगी 😀\n",

      "24/10/22, 11:22 - Anuj Gupta: It is good to be introvert. Let the actions and achievements speak rather than words and they actually do. I have realised over the years that in being extrovert, people lose their focus and end up over committing and delivering less. If we commit less and deliver quality, people value us more. Very correctly said, introverts are selectively social. Certainly, we all have a periphery around us which we call as Circle of Influence. Only few should be coming in. Let the book be understood by its cover first and only when one wants to read, then only open its pages. Why to keep the book open everytime?\n",

      "\n",
      "Gain and loss is a part of life, that is how the things work in life. Anything and everything that belongs to someone, may or may not stay forever along! Then what is it that lasts forever? A lot of retrospection required!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "Human relationships are an ever happening subject and these never fade away with anything. Time changes, world changes, these keep going their way,\n",
      "\n",
      "One beautiful relation is Friendship. We get friends in life, we get new dimensions, new experiences, new learnings and above all, we are empowered with the Godly power that blesses us every day, every moment and fills us with positivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have diversified thoughts in this arena!\n",
      "\n",
      "What is the meaning of friendship? Do we get REAL friends in today's world? What do we expect from friends? What if our expectations are not met? How do money matters get aligned with friendship?\n",
      "\n",
      "Friend in need is a friend indeed. If someone is unable to help, does it go away? Difficult to define? \n",
      "\n",
      "My definition is that Friendship is a relationship all above the dynamics of the entire World's economy and ecosystems. Someone who teaches you how to live life to the best, shows you the path to become successful and gain prosperity in life, someone who does not cry with you but teaches you how to come out of pain and shed off the tears, someone who may not laugh with you but teaches you as to how to cherish each and every moment of life, keep your smile intact at every moment, someone who may not give you money but shows you the way to earn it with honesty, someone who might not hold your hold in crisis, but walks along and ensures that you do not fall, someone who transforms you into a contented person and helps you to take the best out of life is a FRIEND.\n",

      "01/11/22, 09:57 - Anuj Gupta: Here is a very important and integral aspect of our lives and it is more of one’s personality traits viz. Contentment. Let us talk about it and put thoughts together!\n",
      "\n",
      "Have we ever thought as to how we could stay contented? We go through the journey of life, come across different stages, different people and pass through different situations. We all at some or the other point of time talk about what we have, what we lack and what we need further. Do we ever have this answer that one has got enough?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think this is an ever progressing and unending debate. If we get contented, we shall stop thinking of growth. If we never get contented, we shall ever crib. However the question is then as to how to be happy because both ways we lose our cool and always get into circles of looking for one thing or other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us take a tangent here. Let us answer one question to ourselves and not the rest of the world. Who is managing the entire world? Do we control anything in this world? We often tend to think that we control too many things but is it actually so?\n",
      "\n",
      "I think we are all connected to each other one way or the other and some supernatural power governs us. What we think that we control is actually not in our hands. It is a part of sequences which get created as a result of our actions and decide the destiny. Input proportionates the output.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, my thought would be that we should live the life to the best, every day is a new day and every moment brings a fresh lease of life. We need to cherish the time. Time never stops. So go with time. Be thankful to the Trinity for giving every moment to us and take the best out of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently I learnt a new thing. Get into get togethers with people who understand you and you get to know what they look for. Go for an outing, smile, laugh, eat, dance and spend quality time. Learn from them about their good things and improve in self. Socialism if managed well can get us great avenues and opportunities to progress better in life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contentment is nothing but a state of your mind. It is connected to your heart and soul. It does not come by spending money or building status or making the world admire you. It comes from within your soul , it is a message that your inner self gives you and fills you with happiness and positivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Start loving and valuing yourself, get into things which you are passionate about, eat the food of your choice, visit places you live to go and bridge with people who make you feel at home.\n",

      "30/11/22, 09:22 - Anuj Gupta: SOME SOCIAL RULES THAT MAY HELP YOU:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Don’t call someone more than twice continuously. If they don’t pick up your call, presume they have something important to attend to;\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Return money that you have borrowed even before the person that borrowed you remember or ask for it. It shows your integrity and character. Same goes with umbrellas, pens and lunch boxes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Never order the expensive dish on the menu when someone is giving you a lunch/dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Don’t ask awkward questions like ‘Oh so you aren’t married yet?’ Or ‘Don’t you have kids’ or ‘Why didn’t you buy a house?’ Or why don't you buy a car? For God’s sake it isn’t your problem;\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Always open the door for the person coming behind you. It doesn’t matter if it is a guy or a girl, senior or junior. You don’t grow small by treating someone well in public;\n",
      "\n",
      "6. If you take a taxi with a friend and he/she pays now, try paying next time;\n",
      "\n",
      "7. Respect different shades of opinions. Remember what's 6 to you will appear 9 to someone facing you. Besides, second opinion is good for an alternative;\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Never interrupt people talking. Allow them to pour it out. As they say, hear them all and filter them all;\n",
      "\n",
      "9. If you tease someone, and they don’t seem to enjoy it, stop it and never do it again. It encourages one to do more and it shows how appreciative you're;\n",
      "\n",
      "10. Say “thank you” when someone is helping you.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. Praise publicly. Criticize privately;\n",
      "\n",
      "12. There’s almost never a reason to comment on someone’s weight. Just say, “You look fantastic.” If they want to talk about losing weight, they will;\n",
      "\n",
      "13. When someone shows you a photo on their phone, don’t swipe left or right. You never know what’s next;\n",
      "\n",
      "14. If a colleague tells you they have a doctors' appointment, don’t ask what it’s for, just say \"I hope you’re okay\". Don’t put them in the uncomfortable position of having to tell you their personal illness. If they want you to know, they'll do so without your inquisitiveness;\n",
      "\n",
      "15. Treat the cleaner with the same respect as the CEO. Nobody is impressed at how rude you can treat someone below you but people will notice if you treat them with respect;\n",
      "\n",
      "16. If a person is speaking directly to you, staring at your phone is rude;\n",
      "\n",
      "17. Never give advice until you’re asked;\n",
      "\n",
      "18. When meeting someone after a long time, unless they want to talk about it, don’t ask them their age and salary;\n",
      "\n",
      "19. Mind your business unless anything involves you directly - just stay out of it;\n",
      "\n",
      "20. Remove your sunglasses if you are talking to anyone in the street. It is a sign of respect. Moreso, eye contact is as important as your speech; and\n",
      "\n",
      "21. Never talk about your riches in the midst of the poor. Similarly, don't talk about your children in the midst of the barren.\n",
      "\n",
      "22. After reading a good message try to say \"Thanks for the message\".\n",
      "\n",
      "APPRECIATION remains the easiest way of getting what you don't have.\n",

      "\n",
      "6. Other factors- they compliment us but still the equation remains incomplete.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. I agree that everyone has a different perception. What appears as M to someone, appears as W to the other. After all everyone is different😐.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. Contentment is a state of mind. What we perceive is what we infer and inference is someone’s own intellect!\n",
      "\n",
      "9. I think that we all have a predefined mind set which is quite judgemental and has a tendency to do the things the way we want them to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. So, the points that are mentioned above are considered and assessed differently by all and it is a mix in every situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "11. What we need to understand is as to what we want to accomplish in life, how we want to go ahead, what is our methodology to carve out our action plan, how we want to create a difference in positive aspects and how the value is generated in all facets of life?🤔\n",
      "\n",
      "12. We all start our day with plans, make schedules, do our work and get results. \n",

      "13. Do we ever do a SWOT analysis of what all we did in  the day (Strength, Weekness, Opportunities and Threat)?\n",
      "\n",
      "14. We follow our beliefs, we admire our principles, we strongly support our decisiveness. \n",
      "\n",
      "15. However, do we ever analyse the degree of contentment that we got at the closing of the day. Or we were simply counting our bank balances 😇😇\n",
      "\n",
      "16. How did our actions and reactions make a difference. Did we create a thought for someone that we brought positivity?\n",
      "\n",
      "17. There are lessons and teachings that we get from our Principals and Principles (try to understand these words and their gist here) and what we tend to give others to follow.\n",
      "\n",
      "18. In reality, have we ever understood the gist of these ourselves and applied them in reality to our lives. If yes, have we measured the resultant?\n",
      "\n",
      "19. Things need to be simplified. \n",
      "\n",
      "20. 1+1=2 . Why do we tend to create our own equations and complicate the thoughts?\n",
      "\n",
      "21. Why do we tend to portray ourselves to be perfectionists when we donot have clear answers to very basis questions?\n",
      "\n",
      "22. Contentment comes from one simple belief which is simplistic and honest way of doing things. \n",
      "\n",
      "23. We need to come out of our shells that we have created and hided ourselves in these.\n",
      "\n",

      "1. I have been thinking about this subject at times and a lot of thoughts come up. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. We talk about being rich or poor or middle class at times. What exactly do these mean from the perspective of one's perception?\n",
      "\n",
      "3. First of all, we need to define what it means by being rich? Is this referring to someone's bank balance, or the property that one has had or the business turnover or what is it?\n",
      "\n",
      "4. In majority, it drills down to money. So, is money everything that one can vouch for or is this something much beyond?\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Look, there are three entities: Necessities, Comforts and Luxuries!\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Majority of the people around us work to fulfill their necessities. It takes years for a person to move from making 10,000 to 100,000 a month. \n",
      "\n",
      "7. So, if we ask a person from the lower range, they would not even bother to differentiate these three. They would have had their own ways of enjoying life.  \n",
      "\n",
      "8. Ask a person from the higher band. They would still contemplate deciding if their daily expenses are met. Reason, higher the inflow, the more is the need to spend. \n",
      "\n",
      "9. A person with more money will tend to have a bigger need to save than a person with lesser money many times. \n",
      "\n",
      "10. So, where is the Math and how is this done?\n",
      "\n",
      "11. So, it gets difficult to understand how we define Wealthy (state of being rich).\n",
      "\n",
      "12. Somebody once told me. Earning is important. Spending is the requirement. However, when to spend, how much to spend and where to spend - these are very important and most of us do not have clarity on managing it. We just tend to run after the numbers.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Life is full of colors and experiences. \n",
      "\n",
      "14. Savings are earnings. Earnings need to be saved.\n",
      "\n",
      "15. I think from where I look at it, it is more important to have a qualitative perspective on this than being quantitative.\n",
      "\n",
      "16. Go for quality in life. Segregate the things among Good, Better and the Best. \n",
      "\n",
      "17. Look for the best. Do not compromise. \n",
      "\n",
      "18. Anything which appears costly may not be worthy every time. At the same time, something which is not expensive may not be inferior in quality. We need to have a clear thought on this.\n",
      "\n",
      "19. We need to understand and recognize the difference between glass and diamond. Both look transparent.\n",
      "\n",
      "20. However, glass is fragile and breaks while diamond is strong and the whole world knows its strength and the worth.\n",

      "21. State of being rich or poor does not teach this difference. It is your intellect. Utilize it to the fullest and the best.\n",
      "\n",
      "22. We do not get richer by what we have earned or saved. \n",

      "\n",

      "09/04/23, 15:19 - Anuj Gupta: एक पहलवान जैसा, हट्टा-कट्टा, लंबा-चौड़ा व्यक्ति सामान लेकर किसी स्टेशन पर उतरा। उसनेँ एक टैक्सी वाले से कहा कि मुझे साईँ बाबा के मंदिर जाना है।\n",
      "\n",
      "टैक्सी वाले नेँ कहा- 200 रुपये लगेँगे। उस पहलवान आदमी नेँ बुद्दिमानी दिखाते हुए कहा- इतने पास के दो सौ रुपये, आप टैक्सी वाले तो लूट रहे हो। मैँ अपना सामान खुद ही उठा कर चला जाऊँगा।\n",
      "\n",
      "वह व्यक्ति काफी दूर तक सामान लेकर चलता रहा। कुछ देर बाद पुन: उसे वही टैक्सी वाला दिखा, अब उस आदमी ने फिर टैक्सी वाले से पूछा – भैया अब तो मैने आधा से ज्यादा दुरी तर कर ली है तो अब आप कितना रुपये लेँगे?\n",
      "\n",
      "टैक्सी वाले नेँ जवाब दिया- 400 रुपये।\n",
      "\n",
      "उस आदमी नेँ फिर कहा- पहले दो सौ रुपये, अब चार सौ रुपये, ऐसा क्योँ।\n",
      "\n",
      "टैक्सी वाले नेँ जवाब दिया- महोदय, इतनी देर से आप साईँ मंदिर की विपरीत दिशा मेँ दौड़ लगा रहे हैँ जबकि साईँ मँदिर तो दुसरी तरफ है।\n",
      "\n",
      "उस पहलवान व्यक्ति नेँ कुछ भी नहीँ कहा और चुपचाप टैक्सी मेँ बैठ गया।\n",
      "\n",
      "इसी तरह जिँदगी के कई मुकाम मेँ हम किसी चीज को बिना गंभीरता से सोचे सीधे काम शुरु कर देते हैँ, और फिर अपनी मेहनत और समय को बर्बाद कर उस काम को आधा ही करके छोड़ देते हैँ। किसी भी काम को हाथ मेँ लेनेँ से पहले पुरी तरह सोच विचार लेवेँ कि क्या जो आप कर रहे हैँ वो आपके लक्ष्य का हिस्सा है कि नहीँ।\n",
      "\n",
      "हमेशा एक बात याद रखेँ कि दिशा सही होनेँ पर ही मेहनत पूरा रंग लाती है और यदि दिशा ही गलत हो तो आप कितनी भी मेहनत का कोई लाभ नहीं मिल पायेगा। इसीलिए दिशा तय करेँ और आगे बढ़ेँ कामयाबी आपके हाथ जरुर थामेगी।\n",

      "I am writing to seek your medical advice regarding some symptoms that have been troubling me lately. Specifically, I have been experiencing persistent coughing, a runny nose, frequent sneezing, and discomfort in the nostrils and eye area when my nose is blocked. Given that there is a family history of allergic sinusitis and allopathic doctors have confirmed this diagnosis for me, I am concerned about the cause of these symptoms. In addition, I have noticed that eating anything cold deteriorates my condition, resulting in a runny nose and sore throat. \n",
      "Additionally, I have been facing difficulty in breathing and suffering from a constant dry cough for the past few days. Also, I have been experiencing constant coughing every night while sleeping, which is causing me to wake up frequently. I suspect that this is due to my dust and pollen allergies, which have been problematic for me in the past.\n",

      "01/05/23, 20:41 - Anuj Gupta: *Thought for today!*\n",
      "\n",
      "1. I have had a thought about this subject of one's fitment in a system!\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Let us get into the depths of this. I think as and when a person thinks of one's personality and traits, one thing that definitely comes in his mind as to how one fits among the people around.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Every individual is different - different personality, different thoughts, different qualities, different deltas, different perceptions and different goals in life. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. The point that I want to emphasize is that one should know about what kind of society, what kind of circle, what kind of place and various other factors ; one can fit in.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. How is this relevant to one's success in life, one's prosperity and one's way to live a soulful, peaceful and contented life?\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Humans are social beings. To live alone is difficult and we all need to be among people. However, everyone walks alone at some or the other time.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. I think everyone needs to be clear about one's interests. One needs to understand what kind of people would understand one, value one and vice versa. If this is clear then the association generates value for everyone.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. To be educated does not mean as to how qualified one is. What it means is how well one can understand the situations, the subjects and have a wise and intelligent thinking about addressing these.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. The more experience one gains, one should learn to have a better analysis of subjects , better methodology to handle these and then yield better results.\n",
      "\n",
      "10. However, one needs to be surrounded by people whom one understands and who understands one. \n",
      "\n",
      "11. Look, one doesn't buy everything which is costly and at the same time, everything which is costly may not be worth buying.\n",
      "\n",
      "12. We can buy anything that is not costly but everything which does not have a high cost may not be worth considering too.\n",
      "\n",
      "13. Everyone cannot be friends but at the same time, one cannot go and find friends everywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "14. If one keeps looking for perfect people in this world, one would be left alone. \n",
      "\n",
      "15. However, at the same time, one needs to have perfect people from the perspective of fitting in one's kind of ecosystem. \n",
      "\n",
      "16. So, one has to be selective and intelligent. Respect everyone's thoughts!\n",
      "\n",
      "17. So what is the message? \n",
      "\n",
      "18. Anyone and everyone:\n",
      "Realize your inner self\n",
      "Understand your goals of life\n",
      "Revisit your values\n",
      "Respect your thoughts \n",
      "19. Then look for friends who understand you and walk along on longer paths. \n",
      "\n",
      "20. A mutually respectful association which generates positivity and makes life more contented and happy!\n",

      "Life gives experiences. At times in life , we come across situations which are unpredictable. We don't understand as to what to decide and what is right? One thought that comes to mind is that at times, the power of a good soul is very strong and has the ability to understand the right step to be taken and take the appropriate path. \n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest question that comes up is as how to understand the situation which puts one to get into a space where he loses the intellectual decision making power. What is it? Fear is the biggest factor. Messages that the brain sends us are basically according to what we are thinking and our entire system starts functioning that way. If you feel scared that something may happen to you, you immediately develop that fear and then your brain starts showing you those symptoms. Over and excessive thinking is sin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now what is the way to handle these?\n",
      "\n",
      "If you do not have the capability, then listen to what the other is saying. believe him and follow. Some people are born leaders and have the capability to analyse the situation and address it. They are not scared.\n",
      "\n",
      "You know what the gist is. We all talk about a lot of things in life. We talk of success, failures, achievements, goals and big fundamentals. How many of us make our lives simple? How many look at the reality of life . Do we have the capability to pre-sense the situations and handle them?\n",
      "\n",
      "Those few exceptional people are the ones who have that divine power in them which connects them every time to that superpower which controls this Universe. They actually have that energy which fills their and everyone's life with positivity and life. Gist is to adore them and admire them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Question is as to how we can become like them. My answer is we cannot. They are born like this. They did not work to make them like this. All was inherited from the Super Power. Admire them, adore them, follow them and above all, learn from their actions and try to inculcate in ourselves.\n",

Human brain is the most powerful creation of the God and nothing seems to be impossible for humans in the world except that they cannot challenge the life cycle and time. Life is prevalent in various aspects of the creatures created in the world and life has various forms, various stages. The biggest subject which  carries the most important role in Life is love. When we talk of love, it is complimented with relationships.\\n\\nAs an intellectual, I would want to put emphasis on this subject. These two words appear very simple but in reality, they control the entire life cycle of the happenings in Universe. Love is a bond, it is a feeling, it is a commitment, it is dedication and above all, the most beautiful creation of the God which binds one soul to another.\\n\\nI have covered various aspects of Love and Relationships in my book. Let me provide a gist of the subjects covered in my book as below.\\n\\n1. Love - What it means?\\n2. How does love govern our lives?\\n3. Is love about physical and emotional bonding?\\n4. How do you define relationships between two individuals?\\n5. Is relationship mutual or it is all about dedication?\\n6. Relationships and Human values\\n7. Love and Sacrifice\\n8. Love, Passion and Obsession\\n9. Love and Loyalty\\n10. Love beyond boundaries of religions, age, geographies and social limitations.\\n\\nIn every chapter, I have covered some detailed aspects and practical situations in life.

We realise that definitely, today's youth is tending to live its life their own way and they somehow, have a strong disconnect with the traditional practices which are being followed world over. They donot stick to a healthy lifestyle and donot have a healthy diet. However, they are still more health conscious. They have a strong eye on the health parameters and if someone has a health issue, he or she is more prompt to approach a doctor. The people in today's time donot follow the instructions given to them by their elders in the family immediately and their counter these advises. However, they apply their intelligence, logics and then do research on the problems and then take action. Today's youth is more prompt in approaching diagnostic centers and get their tests done without doctor's advise. They would rather take the report to the doctor and then seek a treatment. You know why? They are more confident about themselves rather than listening to elders and believing the God that everything will be alright. They trust their actions and not beliefs of others. Knowledge is a bliss. Trust is a power. Absence of one of these lead to problems. Today's youth is full of these and tend to grow continuously on these fronts. Earlier , people used to have more fears about health and they used to stick to particular life styles, but they never analysed the causes of health problems when these occurred. They just put tot the God to take care of them. Some problems were cured by doctors, some went on their own and remaining, they had to face the consequences. So, all these reasons imply that average standard of the health will be better in the future than it is now.\\n\\nI would cite a live example from my life. My son was diagnosed recently with a kidney stone. He suffered huge pains and we were literally helpless. We could not go out to doctors due to Corona fears. We tried various things viz. giving homeopathic medicines, excessive water for drinking etc. , but nothing worked. Then took medication from a Urologist and that did the things. Now, when we finally analysed the entire sequence of events, we realised that our son suffered from this because of this attitude. He never drank plenty of water. Whenever, we told him to do so, he ignored. We blamed him all the time for his habits.\\n\\nThen he asked me a question as to why I could not guide him properly to follow a healthy lifestyle. He could drink water only when he felt need for it. He suffered from pain but he had the capacity to bear it and developed a faith in himself that he would be alright soon. He took medicines and continued to spend his time thinking that things would be alright. Also, he studied about the stones in this time on internet and figured out various things which could help him in future to avoid their re-occurrence. All it was about his trust and faith in his knowledge which he gained during this crisis. HE emerged stronger as a person. Instead of cursing God and his habits, he analysed the sequences and devised strategies to live his life in a more healthy way.\\n\",\n 'Anuj Gupta: http://bit.do/fFSFD\\n',\n 'Anuj Gupta: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=B7gAerOgoFc\\n',\n 'Anuj Gupta: https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/mhindi.sakshi.com/amp/news/national/three-homeopathic-medicines-tips-during-corona-crisis-dr-k-rastogi-76549\\n',\n 'Anuj Gupta: How do we feel existence of God?

Ha e we analysed ever as to why that small child inside us or that trait inside us is affected at times by happenings around? At times, things happen - some are real and some are just interactions, some are confrontations and some are illusions. Why do moods swing?\\nWe talk of connections of souls. What rips apart the bonds. Why are relationships so fragile? If there are internal bonds, why external factors suddenly come in and start dominating???\\n',\n 'Anuj Gupta: I think 🤔 there is lack of trait to take a stop over and go over the things again and then make a decision at times. Sudden response to a situation is called reaction and that 90% of us do. Rethinking and understanding the things is analysis. Taking the correct action in the base of analysis is called action !!!\\nHow we Newton said that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. \\nSo there will be reactions. But to handle reactions. If there is no reaction, that violates nature’s laws. Reaction gives a room of thoughts as to understand the gravity of things. What is good, what is bad, how to read human psyche- this is inferred.\\nQuestion arises again. Action and reaction are fine but where is that bond which binds us?\\nFragility means weak bond or is it just an illusion?\\n',\n 'Anuj Gupta: The whole ecosystem is about happenings, developments, results, thought processes, strategies etc. But why does one become so mechanical? We tend to do, do and redo the things. But do we ever or many times apply intellect to look at other side of things? To one , certain things may mean some things in the world. But to another one, some things might mean the entire world.  To some, entire world might not mean anything at all!\\nSo there is a diversity of people, thoughts, psychologies, values, perceptions. What does anything stop anyone from understanding one core of life?\\n\\nLife is all about doing good things, live happily, spread happiness. We strive entire life to earn big things but how many times, we really analyse as to have we lived the way as if we have never lived. We just breathed and had food and did things etc etc.\\n',\n 'Anuj Gupta: Values, values and values!!!!\\nWhich Goddamn value we talk and believe? Have we ever analysed. These values change every moment. Parameters change but what about our inner self, our beliefs, our definitions. They keep getting influenced one way or the other.\\n\\nRetrospection, retrospection, retrospection!!!!!!!!!\\n\\nTime is a wonderful entity. There is no end to it. But it doesn’t return back once gone. We gain, we lose but do we take out learning and lessons from anything ????\\n',\n \"Mommy: Thanks for giving us excellent knowledge. You are a divine person.

That word is, *\\'UP\\'*.  It is listed in the dictionary as an [adv], [prep], [adj], [n] or [v].\\n      It\\'s easy to understand *UP*, meaning toward the sky or at the top of the list, but when we awaken in the morning, why do we wake *UP*?\\n\\n     At a meeting, why does a topic come *UP*?  Why do we speak \\'UP\\', and why are the officers *UP* for election, if there is a tie, it is a toss *UP*, and why is it *UP* to the secretary to write *UP* a report ?    \\n     We call *UP* our friends, brighten *UP* a room, polish *UP* the silver, warm *UP* the leftovers and clean *UP* the kitchen.  We lock *UP* the house and fix *UP* the old car.\\n\\n     At other times, this little word has real special meaning.  People stir *UP* trouble, line UP for tickets, work *UP* an appetite, and think *UP* excuses.\\n\\n     To be dressed is one thing, but to be dressed *UP* is special.\\n\\n     And this *UP* can be confusing. A drain must be opened *UP* because it is blocked *UP* !!!\\n\\n     We open *UP* a store in the morning, but we close it *UP* at night.  We seem to be pretty mixed *UP* about *UP* !!!\\n\\n     To be knowledgeable about the proper uses of *UP*, look *UP* the word *UP* in the dictionary.  In a desk-sized dictionary, it takes *UP* almost 1/4 of the page and can add *UP* to about thirty definitions !!!\\n\\n     If you are *UP* to it, you might try building *UP* a list of the many ways *UP* is used.  It will take *UP* a lot of your time, but if you don\\'t give *UP*, you may wind *UP* with, *UP* to, a hundred or more.\\n\\n     When it threatens to rain, we say it is clouding *UP*. When the sun comes out, we say it is clearing *UP*.  When it rains, it soaks *UP* the earth.

We may have to live with C19 for months or years.  Don't deny or panic.  Don't make your life a misery.  Let's learn to live with this reality.\\n\\n  2. You can't destroy the C19 virus that has penetrated the cell walls, by drinking liters of hot water - you'll just be going to the bathroom more often.\\n\\n  3. Washing your hands and maintaining a physical distance  is your best method of protection.\\n\\n  4. If you do not have a C19 patient at home, there is no need to disinfect your home.\\n\\n  5. Grocery bags / plastic bags, gas stations, shopping carts and ATMs do not cause infection.Wash your hands, live your life as usual.\\n\\n  6. C19 is not a food infection.  It is associated with infectious droplets such as flu.  There is no demonstrated risk that C19 is transmitted by ordering food.\\n\\n  7. You can lose your sense of smell by using a lot of anti-allergies and viral infections.  These are only non-specific symptoms of C19.\\n\\n  8. Once you get home, you don't need to change clothes immediately and take a shower!\\n Cleanliness is a virtue but not paranoia!\\n\\n  9. The C19 virus does not fly through the air.  This is a respiratory drop infection that requires close contact.\\n\\n  10.The air is clean, you can walk to parks and public places (just keep your physical distance for protection)\\n\\n  11. Just use regular soap against C19, no need for anti-bacterial soap.  These are viruses, not bacteria.\\n\\n  12. You don't have to worry about your food orders.  But you can heat everything in the microwave, if you want.\\n\\n  13. The possibility of bringing the C19 home in your shoes is like being struck by lightning twice a day.  I've worked against viruses for 20 years - drop infections don't spread like that!\\n\\n  14. You can't be protected from viruses by consuming vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger!  It's just for immunity not medicine.\\n\\n  15. Wearing a mask for a long time interferes with your breathing and oxygen levels.  Wear it only in crowded places.\\n\\n  16. Wearing gloves is also a bad idea;  the virus can accumulate in gloves and is easily transmitted if you touch your face.  Better to just wash your hands regularly.\\n\\n  17. Immune system gets very weak by always living in a sterile environment.  Even if we are taking immune-boosting supplements / medicines, please regularly leave your house to the park / beach or anywhere else.\\nImmunity is increased by EXPOSURE TO PATHOGENS, not by sitting at home and consuming fried / spicy / sweet foods and fizzy drinks.\\n\\n\\n\\n  First immuno suppression agent: *FEAR*\\n\",\n 'Mommy: <Media omitted>\\n',\n 'Kshitij Gupta: kitna h bill hdfc ka?\\n',\n 'Kshitij Gupta: ??\\n',\n 'Anuj Gupta: Donot do at present\\n',\n 'Anuj Gupta: <Media omitted>\\n',\n 'Anuj Gupta: Name of account holder: Sindhu Kushank\\nAccount Number: 00211000250367\\nType of Account: Savings Bank Account\\nName of bank and branch: HDFC Bank, Lakidikapul Branch\\nIFSC Code: HDFC0000021\\nAddress of Bank Branch: HDFC Bank Ltd., 6-1-73, Gr. and 3rd floor,\\nSaeed Plaza, Lakdikapul, Hyderabad-50004, Andhra Pradesh\\n',\n 'Anuj Gupta: Kushank’s number is - +91 96401 60714\\n',\n 'Kshitij Gupta: Acct XX171 debited with INR 10,001.00 on 20-Nov-20 & Acct XX367 credited.

It is a very beautiful poem and here we have talked about the beauty of nature describing the sky , the birds , the rivers , the sun and the entire life cycle . it is a beautiful experience and I have tried to convert this into a drawing. I had a unique feeling translating this poem into a drawing because with every photo which I drew, I felt as if I was becoming a part of the ecosystem and I could feel the warmth of the nature and it's magic. I could feel as if I was standing in the middle of this picture and watching the things happening in front of me. I felt complete and got lot of positivity and above all a wonderful experience. I am thankful to the almighty to shower us with his blessings in the form of such a beautiful nature.

How important are they in your life?\\n\\nHumans are social beings. They have feelings, emotions and their ways of living life. Values refer to our ethics which mean our perceptions driven by our core inner conscience which tells us as to what is right for us in terms of actions and reactions. Values play an integral part in our life. Without values, we are just living creatures who breathe, eat and do things to live life but we tend to live as if we have never lived life as a human , just a living creature. We need values to keep our self esteem high, equip ourselves with a sense of responsibilities, build relationships and live them with love, affection and dedication. Our values drive us to understand and perform our roles towards our family, society, country and humanity.\\n\\nQ2. What values do you stand by / believe in?\\n\\nBe a good human who knows his/ her duties. Best formula of life is to live peacefully and let others live peacefully. Do your best, don't hurt anyone, give love to all, help others to the best of your capability and above all, don't expect, just do your actions but in the right spirit of doing good with a sense of responsibility.\\n\\nQ3. What changes would you like to see in yourself in the next one year?\\n\\nBecome more mature, focused and develop an understanding of what I aim to be in life.\\n\\nQ4. List some of the changes you would like to see in your country in the next three years?\\n\\nFirst of all, fight the pandemic of Covid and overcome this to live a normal life. Next, we need to control increasing prices. Improve discipline.\\n\\nQ5.

Sawhney (President, MC) & Sh. Bhalla (Secy., MC),\\n\\nWith regard to the display / window advertisement dated 21.03.2021 relating to NIT / RFP regarding FAR work in Green Valley, I wish to make the following submissions :-\\n\\n(i) In the meetings held in the recent past, it was decided in principle to follow the provisions of  GFR, 2017 in totality. However, the same has not been referred, which is very sad.  More disturbing point is that the tender has been floated in a hurry, without paying heed to my suggestions.\\n\\n(ii) Less than 2 weeks' time has been given to the bidders / contractors for submission of the bids, whereas as per GFR minimum time to be given to the bidders for submission of bids is 3 weeks.\\n\\n(iii) In the tender document, there is no mention of pre-bid meeting.\\n\\n(iv) In spite of the fact that only 2 weeks' time has been given for submission of bids (which is not as per provisions of GFR), the NIT has not been uploaded on GV website.  In the circumstances, how can we expect getting good response from the bidders. \\n\\nThe worst part is that the details regarding total FAR / Non FAR area, structural drawings, approved maps of the flats etc. don't find place in the NIT/RFP.  In the absence of the requisite details, how can be expect that good contracts would submit bids.   It seems that we don't need good numbers of bids.\\n\\n(v) As per minutes of the AGM meeting dated 13.10.2019, the tentative cost relating to FAR work was Rs.18.30 Crores.  In the meeting called by you on 15.03.2021 in the Community Centre, it was apprised that in the wake of hike in prices of cement and steel, project cost may go up approximately by 10%.  Going by that, the estimated price could have been around Rs.20 Crores and not 25 Crores.  \\n\\nI believe, despite all odds , members of the GV should have been taken into confidence before releasing the NIT with estimated cost of Rs. 25.11 Cr.., .\\n\\n(vi)    In the meeting called by you on 15.03.2021, I had requested inter-alia for providing estimated cost of the FAR project of GV on the basis of per square foot area also (in addition to the estimated cost worked out on the basis of schedule of quantities).  The intention was to have an idea as to which option is more economical.\\n\\n2.     In the end, I would like you to intimate composition of the Tender Commitee which shall evaluate the technical bids of the bidders / contractors on 04.04.2021.\\n\\n\\n(Naresh Kumar Sharma)\\nI-701, Green Valley CGHS Ltd.\\n\",\n 'Kshitij Gupta: Fingerlickerz Pav Bhaji & Vada Pav\\n099907 77769\\nhttps://maps.app.goo.gl/nMtXNaS114yUWnpS9\\n',\n 'Anuj Gupta: <Media omitted>\\n',\n 'Anuj Gupta: https://www.google.co.in/amp/s/www.ndtv.com/india-news/62-258-fresh-coronavirus-cases-in-india-sharpest-single-day-surge-in-over-five-months-1-19-crore-total-cases-2400025%3famp=1&akamai-rum=off\\n',\n 'Anuj Gupta: <Media omitted>\\n',\n 'Mommy: <Media omitted>\\n',\n 'Mommy: Bring bread,milk,adrak\\n',\n 'Mommy: I will go Mandi tomorrow\\n',\n 'Mommy: <Media omitted>\\n',\n 'Mommy: <Media omitted>\\n',\n 'Mommy: <Media omitted>\\n',\n 'Mommy: <Media omitted>\\n',\n 'Mommy: <Media omitted>\\n',\n 'Anuj Gupta: #ShareInvitation Fill my invitation code Q746S to pick me!
