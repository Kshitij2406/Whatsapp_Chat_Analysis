25/02/20, 23:29 - Anuj Gupta: This world is full of complexities and so is carries the most important and human mankind. Human brain is the most powerful creation of the God and nothing seems to be impossible for humans in the world except that they cannot challenge the life cycle and time. Life is prevalent in various aspects of the creatures created in the world and life has various forms, various stages. The biggest subject which  carries the most important role in Life is love. When we talk of love, it is complimented with relationships.

As an intellectual, I would want to put emphasis on this subject. These two words appear very simple but in reality, they control the entire life cycle of the happenings in Universe. Love is a bond, it is a feeling, it is a commitment, it is dedication and above all, the most beautiful creation of the God which binds one soul to another.

I have covered various aspects of Love and Relationships in my book. Let me provide a gist of the subjects covered in my book as below.

1. Love - What it means?
2. How does love govern our lives?
3. Is love about physical and emotional bonding?
4. How do you define relationships between two individuals?
5. Is relationship mutual or it is all about dedication?
6. Relationships and Human values
7. Love and Sacrifice
8. Love, Passion and Obsession
9. Love and Loyalty
10. Love beyond boundaries of religions, age, geographies and social limitations.

In every chapter, I have covered some detailed aspects and practical situations in life.  We would focus on explaining as to how we can live a better and meaning full life with adherence to these values.

Best,
Kshitij Gupta

08/06/20, 20:13 - Anuj Gupta: Write about the following topic:

The average standard of people's health is likely to be lower in the future than it is now.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
08/06/20, 20:13 - Anuj Gupta: I  would strongly disagree with this statement. We realise that definitely, today's youth is tending to live its life their own way and they somehow, have a strong disconnect with the traditional practices which are being followed world over. They donot stick to a healthy lifestyle and donot have a healthy diet. However, they are still more health conscious. They have a strong eye on the health parameters and if someone has a health issue, he or she is more prompt to approach a doctor. The people in today's time donot follow the instructions given to them by their elders in the family immediately and their counter these advises. However, they apply their intelligence, logics and then do research on the problems and then take action. Today's youth is more prompt in approaching diagnostic centers and get their tests done without doctor's advise. They would rather take the report to the doctor and then seek a treatment. You know why? They are more confident about themselves rather than listening to elders and believing the God that everything will be alright. They trust their actions and not beliefs of others. Knowledge is a bliss. Trust is a power. Absence of one of these lead to problems. Today's youth is full of these and tend to grow continuously on these fronts. Earlier , people used to have more fears about health and they used to stick to particular life styles, but they never analysed the causes of health problems when these occurred. They just put tot the God to take care of them. Some problems were cured by doctors, some went on their own and remaining, they had to face the consequences. So, all these reasons imply that average standard of the health will be better in the future than it is now.

I would cite a live example from my life. My son was diagnosed recently with a kidney stone. He suffered huge pains and we were literally helpless. We could not go out to doctors due to Corona fears. We tried various things viz. giving homeopathic medicines, excessive water for drinking etc. , but nothing worked. Then took medication from a Urologist and that did the things. Now, when we finally analysed the entire sequence of events, we realised that our son suffered from this because of this attitude. He never drank plenty of water. Whenever, we told him to do so, he ignored. We blamed him all the time for his habits.

Then he asked me a question as to why I could not guide him properly to follow a healthy lifestyle. He could drink water only when he felt need for it. He suffered from pain but he had the capacity to bear it and developed a faith in himself that he would be alright soon. He took medicines and continued to spend his time thinking that things would be alright. Also, he studied about the stones in this time on internet and figured out various things which could help him in future to avoid their re-occurrence. All it was about his trust and faith in his knowledge which he gained during this crisis. HE emerged stronger as a person. Instead of cursing God and his habits, he analysed the sequences and devised strategies to live his life in a more healthy way.

11/06/20, 11:37 - Anuj Gupta: How do we feel existence of God? He is within us. Does it happen to you when you think of Him, some face appears in front of your eyes. In other way, if you think of someone, Godly feelings come in. Do we feel the warmth, is soul obsessed and blessed?
11/06/20, 11:38 - Anuj Gupta: How do you feel thinking about it through out the life. Are you not complete in yourself by this divine power?
11/06/20, 11:38 - Anuj Gupta: Do we feel the vibes of the soul
11/06/20, 11:39 - Anuj Gupta: Are souls connected ?
11/06/20, 11:39 - Anuj Gupta: Do we feel the connection
11/06/20, 11:43 - Anuj Gupta: If you are connected to a soul, do other souls connected to it recognise you in some way and connect to you?
11/06/20, 11:43 - Anuj Gupta: Does it happen to you in life that you get bonded to someone without even knowing about one
11/06/20, 11:44 - Anuj Gupta: But do one realise if it is a true feeling or just an illusion
11/06/20, 11:44 - Anuj Gupta: Does one live life in illusion or is it a true thing??????
11/06/20, 13:08 - Anuj Gupta: Puchchi. You should analyse this and explain
12/06/20, 11:03 - Anuj Gupta: <Media omitted>
12/06/20, 11:12 - Anuj Gupta: What is inner self? Ha e we analysed ever as to why that small child inside us or that trait inside us is affected at times by happenings around? At times, things happen - some are real and some are just interactions, some are confrontations and some are illusions. Why do moods swing?
We talk of connections of souls. What rips apart the bonds. Why are relationships so fragile? If there are internal bonds, why external factors suddenly come in and start dominating???
12/06/20, 11:20 - Anuj Gupta: I think 🤔 there is lack of trait to take a stop over and go over the things again and then make a decision at times. Sudden response to a situation is called reaction and that 90% of us do. Rethinking and understanding the things is analysis. Taking the correct action in the base of analysis is called action !!!
How we Newton said that to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. 
So there will be reactions. But to handle reactions. If there is no reaction, that violates nature’s laws. Reaction gives a room of thoughts as to understand the gravity of things. What is good, what is bad, how to read human psyche- this is inferred.
Question arises again. Action and reaction are fine but where is that bond which binds us?
Fragility means weak bond or is it just an illusion?
12/06/20, 11:28 - Anuj Gupta: The whole ecosystem is about happenings, developments, results, thought processes, strategies etc. But why does one become so mechanical? We tend to do, do and redo the things. But do we ever or many times apply intellect to look at other side of things? To one , certain things may mean some things in the world. But to another one, some things might mean the entire world.  To some, entire world might not mean anything at all!
So there is a diversity of people, thoughts, psychologies, values, perceptions. What does anything stop anyone from understanding one core of life?

Life is all about doing good things, live happily, spread happiness. We strive entire life to earn big things but how many times, we really analyse as to have we lived the way as if we have never lived. We just breathed and had food and did things etc etc.
12/06/20, 11:32 - Anuj Gupta: Values, values and values!!!!
Which Goddamn value we talk and believe? Have we ever analysed. These values change every moment. Parameters change but what about our inner self, our beliefs, our definitions. They keep getting influenced one way or the other.

Retrospection, retrospection, retrospection!!!!!!!!!

Time is a wonderful entity. There is no end to it. But it doesn’t return back once gone. We gain, we lose but do we take out learning and lessons from anything ????
12/06/20, 12:13 - Mommy: Thanks for giving us excellent knowledge. You are a divine person. That is why your soul connects with that godly, divine, undefined person. We are very simple People. Our both soul connects only because of worldly relationship. Sorry but I can't express like you. But hats off to you. You are simply great 👍

Apparently when everyone was having ‘phone disruptions’ earlier this week,  COVID-19 Trackers was added to our phones! 

If you have an Android phone, go under Settings, then click on google, settings and it’s there. 

If you have an iPhone, go to settings, privacy, then health, It’s there but not yet functional."

07/07/20, 16:23 - Mommy: An engineer in a car manufacturing company designs a world class car. The CEO is impressed with the outcome and praised him a lot. 

While trying to bring out the car from the manufacturing area to the showroom, they realised that the car is 2 inches taller than the entrance.

The engineer felt bad that he didn't notice this one before creating the car.

The CEO was confused on how to take it outside of the manufacturing area.

The painter said that they can bring out the car and there will be a few scratches on top of the car which could be touched up later on.

The engineer said that they can break the entrance, take the car out, and later re-do it.

The CEO was not convinced with any ideas and felt like it is a bad sign to break or scratch. 

A Watchman was observing all the drama & slowly approached the CEO.  He wanted to give an idea if they had no problem. 

They wondered what this guy would tell them that the experts could not give.

The watchman said "The car is only a few inches taller than the entrance so, simply release the air in the tyre, the height of the car will sink and can be easily taken out"...

Everyone clapped!!!

Don't analyse the problems only from an expert point of view alone.

Life issues are also the same....

Think Simple...
Do Simple and Live Simple

Release some Air... It could be our 'anger' .... our 'disappointments'... our  'egos'... Our 'confusions' ..

(2) Man and God both met somewhere. Both exclaimed, "My creator."

(3) He asked, are you a Hindu or Muslim? The response came, "I am hungry"!

(4) The fool didn't know it was impossible. So he did it.

(5) "Wrong number," Said a familiar voice.

(6) What if God asks you after you die, "So how was heaven?"

(7) They told me that to make her fall in love I had to make her laugh. But every time she laughs, I am the one who falls in love."

(8) We don't make friends anymore....

30/07/20, 17:40 - Anuj Gupta: Hello Dr Pranshu,
Good day!
This is Sandhya this side, wife of Anuj Gupta. I took treatment for my mother who has frozen shoulder issue. She has started your medication since 3 days and has seen considerable improvement.

My father is suffering from  sciatica problem. It was severe last year and he got allopathy treatment plus physiotherapy done but hardly any improvement. However, it settled somehow after sometime. 

Now suddenly the pain has reappeared severly since 3 days. He has again started last year’s medicines plus therapy but no improvement. He cannot even stand.

I am attaching prescription. Can you please prescribe a treatment for him or he can take the same medicines as given to my mother as she is benefitting.

Regards
Sandhya
30/07/20, 18:04 - Anuj Gupta: Hello Dr. Banerjee,

Good Day!

My name is Sandhya Gupta and I am a resident of Delhi. I want to seek treatment for my father who is 65 years of age. He is a diabetic and has hypertension. Though these are under control and he takes allopathic medicines.

He is suffering from a sciatica problem. It was severe last year and he got allopathy treatment plus physiotherapy done but hardly any improvement. However, it settled somehow after sometime. Now suddenly the pain has reappeared severely since 3 days. He has again started last year’s medicines plus therapy but no improvement. He cannot even stand.

I am attaching the current prescription. Can you please prescribe a treatment for him. I have immense faith in homeopathy and want to avail of this.

Regards
Sandhya

     One word in the English language that could be a noun, verb, adj, adv, prep is "UP".
     Read until the end... you'll have a good laugh !!!

     This two-letter word in English has more meanings than any other two-letter word.  That word is, *'UP'*.  It is listed in the dictionary as an [adv], [prep], [adj], [n] or [v].
      It's easy to understand *UP*, meaning toward the sky or at the top of the list, but when we awaken in the morning, why do we wake *UP*?

     At a meeting, why does a topic come *UP*?  Why do we speak 'UP', and why are the officers *UP* for election, if there is a tie, it is a toss *UP*, and why is it *UP* to the secretary to write *UP* a report ?    
     We call *UP* our friends, brighten *UP* a room, polish *UP* the silver, warm *UP* the leftovers and clean *UP* the kitchen.  We lock *UP* the house and fix *UP* the old car.

     At other times, this little word has real special meaning.  People stir *UP* trouble, line UP for tickets, work *UP* an appetite, and think *UP* excuses.

     To be dressed is one thing, but to be dressed *UP* is special.

     And this *UP* can be confusing. A drain must be opened *UP* because it is blocked *UP* !!!

     We open *UP* a store in the morning, but we close it *UP* at night.  We seem to be pretty mixed *UP* about *UP* !!!

     To be knowledgeable about the proper uses of *UP*, look *UP* the word *UP* in the dictionary.  In a desk-sized dictionary, it takes *UP* almost 1/4 of the page and can add *UP* to about thirty definitions !!!

     If you are *UP* to it, you might try building *UP* a list of the many ways *UP* is used.  It will take *UP* a lot of your time, but if you don't give *UP*, you may wind *UP* with, *UP* to, a hundred or more.

     When it threatens to rain, we say it is clouding *UP*. When the sun comes out, we say it is clearing *UP*.  When it rains, it soaks *UP* the earth. When it does not rain for awhile, things dry *UP*.

     One could go on and on, but I'll wrap it *UP*, for now...... my time is *UP*!

     So, did this whole thing, crack you *UP*?

Send this on to everyone you look *UP* in your address book... or not... it's *UP* to you.😃😃😃👍👍👍

Happy Friendship Day!!

09/08/20, 18:11 - Mommy: Today , I went to the supermarket with the prudence dictated by the new normal. Mask, gel and safety distance. I then started to get the things that were on my short list, and when I was lining up to pay, between taking the money and storing the phone, the 500 rupees note I had to pay fell on the floor, and the man who was in front of me finishing paying his purchases slowly bent down and picked up my note.

Woww.. How much education and kindness in these pandemic times - I thought. I held out my hand, waiting for him to give me back my money, trying to stay away, so that he would feel safe, while preparing to thank him for the gesture.
But suddenly, what he told me was  shocking - What's on the floor belongs to whoever finds it! - and just like that, he left ... naturally, as if he hadn't done anything wrong.

I looked at the lady behind me and the people next to me and they all looked at me in shock and disbelief, whispering things between them.

For a moment there, I was trying to evaluate myself. I wanted to do justice on my own ... I left my purchases, because I had no way to pay, and went after him to the parking lot, to have my 500/- returned. What a THUG!!!!
However, I realized that the people closest to the line came after me, curious to know what was going to happen ...

I spoke to him ...demanding my money but he just looked at me with contempt and acted like I was invisible.

When he got to the car, he slowly put his two shopping bags on the floor to take the key out of his pocket and open the trunk, and I thought - It's now or never!
I took the two bags and told him the same thing he had said to me - "What is on the floor belongs to those who find it! " .......- and I started running towards the exit, between fright and laughter, proud of my revenge.

The spectators started to applaud and I saw that the “smart guy” had been irritated after all, as he left the parking lot dropping security cones in his path.
I swear I felt a rush of adrenaline, fright and nervousness, but then I cried with laughter.
When I got home I opened the bags and found:

- 2 kg apples
- 1 kg of sugar
-  cheese and yogurt of two flavors
- whole grain bread,
-  2 packs of orange juice
- 2 jars of strawberry jam
- 2 kg of very good quality green peas
- 1 jar of mayonnaise, HORLICKS, CHYAWANPRAASH
- 1KG LIQUID SUEF EXCEL
I had never made so many purchases with only 500 rupees
And now here I am ... Having a glass of orange juice, eating and thinking as I write - am I a vigilante or a vindictive person?

HAVE YOU READ THIS UNTIL HERE?
This obviously did not happen to me. It's just a campaign to promote reading! 😂

12/08/20, 22:08 - Anuj Gupta: Dear Bhallaji,
We have been getting a home service since 2 days by society staff. They deliver courier or other stuff which are kept at entry gate by the external vendors.  This is really great and benefitting us. Now the risk of outsiders coming in will go away and  people will go out less, thereby increasing safety.
Now we donot have to go out to the gate to pick stuff.
We realm appreciate this and thank you for this facility👏👏👏

05/09/20, 13:33 - Anuj Gupta: Puchchi anulom vilom is the mother pranayam of all pranayams. If you get this and other ones in your daily routine, this will keep all your problems away which are already in store for you as inherited genetically on which Amy medications in the world have no control in terms if treating them permanently.
05/09/20, 13:35 - Anuj Gupta: To avoid BP and sugar coming in your system by age of 30, you need to get rid of these by pranayams.
05/09/20, 13:36 - Kshitij Gupta: hmm
05/09/20, 13:38 - Anuj Gupta: I am not saying these. Entire medical science supports this. Do google and learn for yourself. Dr Bhatnagar is not going to give treatments forever. Doctors like Kalyan Banerjee and him are found once in 30 years. They took almost three decades of research to get expertise to cure in-curable diseases.
05/09/20, 13:39 - Kshitij Gupta: hmm
05/09/20, 13:44 - Anuj Gupta: Do this calculation. I got stones after 30. You got these at 18.Early arrival by 12 years. I got high BP at 35, sugar at 37. What about you. This time the jump could be more. Does that mean , another 6-7 years for you to become hypertensive and diabetic.   ????????

The solution is in your hands. Nobody in this world can teach you how to control your health except you!!!!!!!!!

11/09/20, 19:57 - Anuj Gupta: लखनऊ के एक नवाब साहब को किसी ने *"गधा"* बोल दिया।

नवाब साहब को ये बहुत नागवार गुज़रा और उन्होंने कोर्ट में केस कर दिया। जज ने गधा बोलने वाले से पूछा तो उसने अपनी ग़लती मानते हुए माफ़ी माँग ली।

जज ने नवाब साहब से कहाः *"नवाब साहब अब तो ये माफ़ी माँग रहा है, आपका क्या कहना है?"*

इस पर नवाब साहब माफ़ी देने के लिये तैयार हो गये -- लेकिन शर्त रखी कि वह आदमी अब कभी किसी नवाब को गधा नहीं बोलेगा।

वो आदमी मान गया कि अब किसी नवाब को वो गधा नहीं बोलेगा।

जज ने मुजरिम को बरी कर दिया।

जाने से पहले उस आदमी ने जज साहब से पूछाः *"योर हॉनर, मैं नवाब साहब को तो कत्तई गधा नहीं बोलूंगा लेकिन एक बात बताइये कि गधे को तो मैं नवाब साहब बोल सकता हूँ कि नहीं?"*

जज ने कहा: *"गधे को आप कुछ भी बोलिए, कोर्ट का उससे कोई लेना देना नहीं है।"*

वो आदमी नवाब साहब की तरफ मुड़ा और बोलाः *अच्छा "नवाब साहब" चलता हूँ!"*

15/11/20, 19:37 - Anuj Gupta: Manager of a Firm, his Assistant and an old woman with her young daughter are traveling in a train and during the course of time get themselves introduced to each other and become temporary friends.

The train goes through a tunnel and it gets completely dark.

Suddenly there is a kissing sound and then a slap.

The train comes out of the tunnel.

The women and the Assistant are sitting there looking perplexed.

The Manager is bending over holding his face, which is red from an apparent slap.

All of them remain diplomatic and nobody says anything.

The Old woman is thinking : “These Managers are all crazy after girls. He must have kissed my daughter in the tunnel. Very proper that she slapped him.”

The Young girl is thinking : “The Manager must have tried to kiss me but kissed my mother instead and got slapped.”

The Manager is thinking : “Damn it. My Assistant must have kissed the young girl. She might have thought it was me and slapped me.”

Now guess what the Assistant is thinking.

Now hold your breath and read what the Assistant is thinking………..

*"If this train goes through another tunnel I will make another kissing sound and slap my Manager again. The Rascal keeps harassing me in the Office".*

18/11/20, 20:53 - Mommy: Covid

  1. We may have to live with C19 for months or years.  Don't deny or panic.  Don't make your life a misery.  Let's learn to live with this reality.

  2. You can't destroy the C19 virus that has penetrated the cell walls, by drinking liters of hot water - you'll just be going to the bathroom more often.

  3. Washing your hands and maintaining a physical distance  is your best method of protection.

  4. If you do not have a C19 patient at home, there is no need to disinfect your home.

  5. Grocery bags / plastic bags, gas stations, shopping carts and ATMs do not cause infection.Wash your hands, live your life as usual.

  6. C19 is not a food infection.  It is associated with infectious droplets such as flu.  There is no demonstrated risk that C19 is transmitted by ordering food.

  7. You can lose your sense of smell by using a lot of anti-allergies and viral infections.  These are only non-specific symptoms of C19.

  8. Once you get home, you don't need to change clothes immediately and take a shower!
 Cleanliness is a virtue but not paranoia!

  9. The C19 virus does not fly through the air.  This is a respiratory drop infection that requires close contact.

  10.The air is clean, you can walk to parks and public places (just keep your physical distance for protection)

  11. Just use regular soap against C19, no need for anti-bacterial soap.  These are viruses, not bacteria.

  12. You don't have to worry about your food orders.  But you can heat everything in the microwave, if you want.

  13. The possibility of bringing the C19 home in your shoes is like being struck by lightning twice a day.  I've worked against viruses for 20 years - drop infections don't spread like that!

  14. You can't be protected from viruses by consuming vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger!  It's just for immunity not medicine.

  15. Wearing a mask for a long time interferes with your breathing and oxygen levels.  Wear it only in crowded places.

  16. Wearing gloves is also a bad idea;  the virus can accumulate in gloves and is easily transmitted if you touch your face.  Better to just wash your hands regularly.

  17. Immune system gets very weak by always living in a sterile environment.  Even if we are taking immune-boosting supplements / medicines, please regularly leave your house to the park / beach or anywhere else.
Immunity is increased by EXPOSURE TO PATHOGENS, not by sitting at home and consuming fried / spicy / sweet foods and fizzy drinks.

04/12/20, 01:07 - Anuj Gupta: Akbar asked Birbal to look for five biggest idiots in his state and produce them in his court within a month.

After a month's extensive search operations, Birbal brought to the court only two people!

"But I asked for five", Akbar angrily asked. 

"Give me a chance to present them one by one", Birbal pleaded and went on to present his idiots:

"Maharaj, this man, while travelling in a bullock cart, was keeping his luggage on his head so as not to hurt the bullocks. He is the first idiot. (In corporate parlance , the ones who take all load on themselves and not delegate)

Pointing to the second man Birbal continued, "And this man here is the second idiot. Some grass grew on the roof of his thatched house and he was trying to force his cow climb up a ladder to graze on them." ( In corporate parlance, these are those who set unrealistic targets and force others to achieve it without realising their capabilities and competency)

Birbal continued, "Maharaj, there were a lot of importants jobs for me to do in the state, but I ignored them and wasted a precious month in searching for idiots. According to me I am the third idiot." ( Idiots who rush obediently for wrong job assignments without any qualms)

Birbal paused here for a moment.

"Who are the fourth and fifth idiots?", Akbar thundered.

"Beg your pardon, Maharaj", Birbal continued, "You are the King and are responsible for the wellbeing of the entire state and its people. You need wise persons to help you oversee the state affairs. Instead of looking for wise people you engaged me to look for idiots. According to me you are the fourth idiot. ( Bad leaders who make poor strategies and want idiots to follow blindly)

And, Maharaj, the person who is glued to this Whatsapp, keeping aside all his high priority assignments, oblivious of pressing needs of his familiy,  just to learn who is the fifth idiot, is the fifth idiot himself. What do you say, Maharaj?" Birbal concluded.

Akbar said, "Post it immediately in all groups.".🤣😜

I told her that the business rules should be transparent and that is a challenge we face. I donot think I have said anything negative about the system. 

I just explained the process. I am really surprised how things are perceived.

20/12/20, 13:36 - Mommy: Very good morning all, my name is Srishti Gupta and I am going to share my experience about comprehending the poem Nurture the nature. It is a very beautiful poem and here we have talked about the beauty of nature describing the sky , the birds , the rivers , the sun and the entire life cycle . it is a beautiful experience and I have tried to convert this into a drawing. I had a unique feeling translating this poem into a drawing because with every photo which I drew, I felt as if I was becoming a part of the ecosystem and I could feel the warmth of the nature and it's magic. I could feel as if I was standing in the middle of this picture and watching the things happening in front of me. I felt complete and got lot of positivity and above all a wonderful experience. I am thankful to the almighty to shower us with his blessings in the form of such a beautiful nature. Thank you

04/01/21, 00:11 - Anuj Gupta: It’s an emerging field and growing in importance/popularity within the last few years. I think it will continue to grow in importance as more enterprises try to make use of data. At a high level it’s a marriage between statistics and computer science. Usually it’s heavy on the statistics side but many CS experts are also genuinely interested in the field. Also other domain sciences are involved but the above two are usually dominant. Depending on the ambitions and inclinations of your son he can approach it from either angle.

*Just try answers for these*

 1. If poison expires; is it more poisonous or is it no longer poisonous?
🤔
2. Which letter is silent in the word "Scent," the S or the C?
🤔
3. Do twins ever realize that one of them is "Unplanned"?
🤔
4. Why is the letter W, in English, called double U? Shouldn't it be called double V?
🤔
5. Maybe Oxygen is slowly killing you and It just takes 75-100 years to fully work.
🤔
6. Every time you clean something, you just make something else dirty.
🤔
7. The word "swims" upside-down is still "swims"
🤔
8. 100 years ago everyone owned a Horse and only the rich had Cars. Today everyone has Cars and only the rich own Horses.
🤔
9. If you replace "W" with "T" in "What, Where and When", you get the answer to each of them.
🤔
*Still have time for fun..?*
*Let's try this*

Six Great Confusions
Which are still unresolved
😄😂
1. At a movie theatre, which arm rest is yours?

2. If people evolve from monkeys, why are monkeys still around?

3. Why is there a 'D' in fridge,
but not in refrigerator?

4.  Who knew what time it was when the first clock was made?

*Well Try this now*
Vagaries of English Language! Enjoy.!!!
😀

•Wonder why the word "Funeral" starts with FUN?

•Why isn't a Fireman called a Water-man?

•How come Lipstick doesn't do what it says?

•If money doesn't grow on trees, how come Banks have Branches?

•If a Vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a Humanitarian eat?

•How do you get off a non-stop Flight?

•Why are goods sent by *Ship* called CARGO, and those sent by *Truck* SHIPMENT?

•Why do we put cups in the "Dishwasher" and the dishes in the "Cupboard"?

•Why do doctors "Practice" medicine? Are they having practice at the cost of the patients?

•Why is it called "Rush Hour" when traffic moves at its slowest then?

•How come Noses run and Feet smell?

•Why do they call it a TV 'set' when there is only one?

•What are you vacating when you go on a "Vacation"?

We can never find the answers
Can we❓

If you have the *Spirit* of understanding everything in a positive manner - You’ll enjoy every moment in LIFE, whether it’s *PRESSURE or PLEASURE*

So just enjoy the PUN and FUN of the English language.
😂🤣😂
Enjoy n have fun.😘👍

Suddenly there is a kissing sound and then a slap.

The train comes out of the tunnel.

The women and the Assistant are sitting there looking perplexed.

The Manager is bending over holding his face, which is red from an apparent slap.

All of them remain diplomatic and nobody says anything.

The Old woman is thinking : “These Managers are all crazy after girls. He must have kissed my daughter in the tunnel. Very proper that she slapped him.”

The Young girl is thinking : “The Manager must have tried to kiss me but kissed my mother instead and got slapped.”

The Manager is thinking : “Damn it. My Assistant must have kissed the young girl. She might have thought it was me and slapped me.”

Now guess what the Assistant is thinking.

Now hold your breath and read what the Assistant is thinking………..

*"If this train goes through another tunnel I will make another kissing sound and slap my Manager again. The Rascal keeps harassing me in the Office".*

18/02/21, 00:31 - Anuj Gupta: Srishti's Assignment
18/02/21, 00:31 - Anuj Gupta: Q1. What are values? How important are they in your life?

Humans are social beings. They have feelings, emotions and their ways of living life. Values refer to our ethics which mean our perceptions driven by our core inner conscience which tells us as to what is right for us in terms of actions and reactions. Values play an integral part in our life. Without values, we are just living creatures who breathe, eat and do things to live life but we tend to live as if we have never lived life as a human , just a living creature. We need values to keep our self esteem high, equip ourselves with a sense of responsibilities, build relationships and live them with love, affection and dedication. Our values drive us to understand and perform our roles towards our family, society, country and humanity.

Q2. What values do you stand by / believe in?

Be a good human who knows his/ her duties. Best formula of life is to live peacefully and let others live peacefully. Do your best, don't hurt anyone, give love to all, help others to the best of your capability and above all, don't expect, just do your actions but in the right spirit of doing good with a sense of responsibility.

Q3. What changes would you like to see in yourself in the next one year?

Become more mature, focused and develop an understanding of what I aim to be in life.

Q4. List some of the changes you would like to see in your country in the next three years?

First of all, fight the pandemic of Covid and overcome this to live a normal life. Next, we need to control increasing prices. Improve discipline.

Q5. Do you know any person / people / institutions who are trying to bring about a positive change?

There is a famous saying - Charity begins at home. So first is myself and then my family - Parents and brother.

Q6. What problems do you foresee in achieving your goal?

Only one thing - Perseverance. This needs to stay. This is something which people lose. I wouldn't want to lose it.

Q7. How would you like to contribute to the betterment of your nation?

Become a responsible citizen. Excel in whatever I do and help people to live their lives better. Develop the sense of responsibility amongst others whom I can influence. Whoever I meet, I aim to tell them one thing - become a good human first. then you can become a better professional.

Subject: Display / window advertisement dated 21.03.2021 relating to NIT / RFP regarding FAR work in Green Valley,
To: <indresh.sawhney@gmail.com>, <narendrabhalla403@gmail.com>


Dear Sh. Sawhney (President, MC) & Sh. Bhalla (Secy., MC),

With regard to the display / window advertisement dated 21.03.2021 relating to NIT / RFP regarding FAR work in Green Valley, I wish to make the following submissions :-

(i) In the meetings held in the recent past, it was decided in principle to follow the provisions of  GFR, 2017 in totality. However, the same has not been referred, which is very sad.  More disturbing point is that the tender has been floated in a hurry, without paying heed to my suggestions.

(ii) Less than 2 weeks' time has been given to the bidders / contractors for submission of the bids, whereas as per GFR minimum time to be given to the bidders for submission of bids is 3 weeks.

(iii) In the tender document, there is no mention of pre-bid meeting.

(iv) In spite of the fact that only 2 weeks' time has been given for submission of bids (which is not as per provisions of GFR), the NIT has not been uploaded on GV website.  In the circumstances, how can we expect getting good response from the bidders. 

The worst part is that the details regarding total FAR / Non FAR area, structural drawings, approved maps of the flats etc. don't find place in the NIT/RFP.  In the absence of the requisite details, how can be expect that good contracts would submit bids.   It seems that we don't need good numbers of bids.

(v) As per minutes of the AGM meeting dated 13.10.2019, the tentative cost relating to FAR work was Rs.18.30 Crores.  In the meeting called by you on 15.03.2021 in the Community Centre, it was apprised that in the wake of hike in prices of cement and steel, project cost may go up approximately by 10%.  Going by that, the estimated price could have been around Rs.20 Crores and not 25 Crores.  

I believe, despite all odds , members of the GV should have been taken into confidence before releasing the NIT with estimated cost of Rs. 25.11 Cr.., .

(vi)    In the meeting called by you on 15.03.2021, I had requested inter-alia for providing estimated cost of the FAR project of GV on the basis of per square foot area also (in addition to the estimated cost worked out on the basis of schedule of quantities).  The intention was to have an idea as to which option is more economical.

2.     In the end, I would like you to intimate composition of the Tender Commitee which shall evaluate the technical bids of the bidders / contractors on 04.04.2021.

31/03/21, 11:29 - Anuj Gupta: 1. Visited the Jamia Millia, Jasola Vihar, Sukhdev Vihar metro stations yesterday. 

2. ETO has been alloted a space to park their EVs at Jamia metro. Also the charging facility is there. 

3. I could click a photo from outside. Looks like a normal EV parking place. Didnot look much technically advanced kind.

4. There are 25 EVs at present which are running. 

5. These EVs operate within 10-15 kilometers. I met some drivers. They told me that they charge vehicle for 6 hours and this last for nearly 80-100 kilometers.

6. As of now the ride booking through app is not functional.

7. These EVs are owned by ETO. They charge 300 rupees per day as rental from the drivers. ETO takes care of all maintenance and charging except minor wear and tear of tires etc.

31/03/21, 19:53 - Anuj Gupta: Sir one point. Presenting this PPT before Virender and the boys there might result in dilution of ideas as Virender has a tendency to mould things his way and will definitely tend to change lot of things in PPT. If that happens, the whole exercise to open a forum of discussion on EV will get diluted.

06/04/21, 23:21 - Anuj Gupta: Today’s findings about opportunities in campus transpiration.

1. I met Dr Pankaj Agarwal, Dy Registrar and Admin head of GGSIP University.
He showed inclination towards establishing a lab rather than providing a campus transport solution as said that hardly any students are coming to University as it is mostly virtual teaching. 
He suggested that GGSIP is open to new innovations and we should come up with some good proposal which can cover various aspects viz. EV solutions, VTS or Research kind stuff and give to the VC. Many of the professors of DTU have studied from GGSIP.

2. NSUT- PA to Pradeep Jaiswal , executive engineer and handing the admin told me that there is no campus transport solution at present in NSUT at present. NSUT is expanding and there can be a good viability for such solutions. So we should come up with some good proposal and meet Mr Pradeep.

1. We are kids, we work to enjoy our childhood and play.

2. We are in schools, we work to study.

3. We get into professional world, we work to build career and our empire.

4. We have a family dependent on us, we work to secure their present and future.

5. We head towards old age, we work to fulfil our dreams by working harder and try to stay healthy to live a happy life free of diseases.

6. We grow old, we work to guide youngsters to do well in their lives.

7. But the question is that throughout our lives, how many of us actually do what we want to do in our lives apart from becoming money minting machines
🤔🤔🤔🤔

8. We should take out sometime everyday and work to do something which acts as good for our soul. May be meditation, reading, study, singing, music etc.

I worship Almighty by listening and singing songs of Kishore. Kishore is God for me!🌹🌹

We have read about your work on the internet and it is really great to know about you.

Looking forward to hear from you.

23/04/21, 19:16 - Anuj Gupta: We have figured out various avenues for services business in the past 1 month. While we are not dropping focus on running pilot in JNU and later running a fleet, in the current circumstances, it looks difficult for the people movement in JNU due to worsening Covid scenario and reduction of oxygen in environment (not only the cylinders but the environment also is too much impacted by pollution and Corona virus). 

I am of the opinion that we would suggest these QRyde services to people:

1. QRyde fleet of EVs with VTS on lease as well as sale. (No manpower involvement, only fleet) The EVs could be QRyde made /assembled/ procured.

2. QRyde fleet with QRyde drivers. We can deploy our fleets in their campuses charging from the consumers. They provide us parking and charging. We could tie up with driver bureaus for providing us with drivers. No hassles of managing them.

3. We could sell customised EVs with QRyde and VTS to companies.

This company is working on such things.

23/04/21, 19:19 - Anuj Gupta: 4. They also tell people to put their EVs on lease in their company and they generate money for them by using these in services.

26/04/21, 00:57 - Anuj Gupta: We are in the Pre-Sales phase. Now after structuring the proposal for JNU, let us understand this week how we will explore the market for our products/services. 

When I say this, I mean that we will scope out who can be the prospects for :
QRyde Fleets - On Lease/ Procurement (EV + VTS Only)
QRyde Fleets - On Lease with VTS and drivers (these are services)
QRyde VTS (people who already have EVs)
Remember, we need to identify what the people want and then we will provide them the solution not that we build first and then sell!!!!!

Now, here is some Gyan. May or may not be available in University management books. Only experience teaches this. We now need to think :
Who can be our customers? - You scoped out JNU, GGSIP, DU. Try to think of places where a lot of movement of people and goods is there.
How will we approach these prospective customers? - Cold calling / telemarketing/ referrals/ tenders/ Email campaigns
How do we find the RPCs (Right Party Contacts)? You cannot be talking to a software developer in a company to convince him to bring EVs in his system. It needs to be an Admin or Transportation guy?
Do you understand what a cold call means?
What is the relevance of telesales?
What is the art of opening a channel of discussion with a prospective client whom you have never interacted with. How do you convince someone in 2 minutes to give you his time?
What is the foremost principle of selling. Need to learn the difference between sales and marketing?
How does CRM differ from sales? 
Do you understand what re-acquisition of customers means?
Do you know that the most successful business entrepreneurs at times said that they never did any sales? They provided solutions. What does it mean?

 * we earnestly request residents to kindly share their status to us. Those who got negative report are excluded from above list. We again plead to residents to inform us. Yesterday we had a case where Mr. Sunil F 201 was given oxygen in isolation centre of GV . He has not informed earlier about this condition but when he approached at 5:30 am - we took help from Dr. Sudhanshu and gave him oxygen and then facilitated his admission in to Venketwara Hospital and he is stable now. We already have two casualties in society- a. Mrs Sarkar b. Mr. Satyanarayan- while we mourn their untimely demise and pray for departed soul but we wish your management committee would have knowing about their status. Perhaps we could have done our bit. We sincerely request residents to keep informed about their health status to Dharminder of our office and Amit Sarin with intimation to undersigned. 
Wish we all remain safe.

उपवास करने से, तन हल्का हो जाता है.  
और बकवास करने से, मन !

इसलिए .... दोस्तों से फोन से, वीडियो कॉल से संपर्क बढ़ाओ !
बकवास करो, एक दूसरे का
मनोबल बढ़ाओ, और *डिप्रेशन से बचो.*
*खुश रहो मस्त रहो और स्वस्थ रहो*

एक घण्टा न्यूज देख लो .... तो लगता है  🤔
कुछ ही घण्टे के मेहमान हैं.
जब से मैंने न्यूज़ देखना बन्द किया 
* सांस भी अच्छी चल रही है,
* फेफड़े भी एकदम टनाटन है, 
वर्ना ... ये तो पूरा इंतजाम किए बैठे है मुक्तिधाम पहुँचाने का.  😜

*अतः सभी मित्रों से अनुरोध है कि सोच को सकारात्मक बनायें, एक दूसरे का मनोबल बढ़ाएं.*
*टी.वी. की व्यर्थ की खबरों को मन पसंद कार्यो में स्वयं को लगाएं और परिवार में खूब एन्जॉय करें*

एक बार एक बंदर को उदासी के कारण
मरने की इच्छा हुई, तो उसने
एक सोते हुए शेर के कान खींच लिये.
शेर उठा और गुस्से से दहाड़ा किसने किया ये ? किसने अपनी मौत बुलायी है ?
बंदर ~ मैं हूँ महाराज ..!!
दोस्तो के अभाव में अत्याधिक उदास हूँ, मरना चाहता हूँ , आप मुझे खा लीजिये.
शेर ने हँसते हुए पूछा ~
मेरे कान खीँचते हुए तुम्हें किसी ने देखा क्या ?
बंदर ~ नहीं महाराज ..!!
शेर ~ ठीक है, 
एक दो बार और खीँचो, बहुत ही अच्छा लगता 

सार :
*अकेले रह-रह कर*
*जंगल का राजा भी बोर हो जाता है.*
*इसलिए अपने दोस्तों के संपर्क में रहें,* 
*कान खीँचते-खिंचाते रहे, पंगा लेते रहें.*
 *सुस्त न रहे, मस्ती करते रहें.*

22/05/21, 20:52 - Anuj Gupta: *Your Wife Is Your Wife*

A married couple were walking through a garden, when suddenly a dog ran towards them.

They both knew it will bite them..

The husband lifted his wife to let the dog bite him rather than his sweetheart.

The dog stopped before them, unsure what to do, barked a little and ran away.

The husband put his wife down, expecting a hug and a few kind words of gratitude from her.

But his wife shouted, “I've seen people throwing stones & sticks at dogs, *this is the first time I see someone trying to throw his wife at a dog*

_Moral : No one else can *misunderstand* a Husband better than a Wife_

25/05/21, 12:10 - Anuj Gupta: ***घर के ब्लैक फंगस से सावधान***

बाजार से आप प्याज खरीद कर लाते हैं कभी आपने देखा होगा उसके ऊपर काली-काली परत जमी रहती है।

असल में यही ब्लैक फंगस (काला फफूंद) होता है।

अआप अपने घरों के फ्रिज के दरवाजे खोलिए उसमें एक रबर लगी मिलेगी।

उस रबर को साफ रखें एवं फ्रिजर को साफ रखें अगर काला काला फंगस दिख रहा हो तो तत्काल उसकी अच्छे ढंग से सफाई कर दें और बराबर उसकी सफाई पर ध्यान दें।

उस रबर पर वो जो काला काला है वही है म्यूकोर्म्यूकोसिस यानी ब्लैक फंगस

अगर आपने ध्यान न दिया तो ये फंगस आपके फ्रिज के अंदर रखे खाद्य पदार्थों के माध्यम से बेहद आसानी से आपके अंदर प्रवेश कर सकता है।

★आटा गूंथ कर फ्रिज में ना रखें।
★ कटे फल फ्रिज में ना रखें।
★प्याज ताजा काटकर खाए, कटा प्याज देर तक ना रखें।
★फ्रिज में रखी हुई ब्रेड कत्तई यूज न करें।
★ए.सी. इस्तेमाल कम से कम करें।

सब कुछ ताजा और तुंरन्त इस्तेमाल करें।
और जिस भी खाद्य पदार्थ पर आपको काला काला फंगस जैसा कुछ भी दिखे उसको तुरन्त सावधानी से नष्ट कर दें।

अपने कूलर, एसी और आरओ मशीन की टोटी भी चेक करते रहिएगा।

बेहद चौकन्ना रहिए, चीजों के बारे में पढ़ते-लिखते रहिए और अपडेट रहिए, चित्त बिल्कुल शांत रखिए, शुद्ध खान पान से इम्युनिटी मजबूत रखिए, और व्यायाम करते रहें और हमेशा सकारात्मक रहें।

सभी अपना ध्यान रखें तो......मजाल है जो कोई फंगस आपको छू भी ले।

30/05/21, 21:05 - Anuj Gupta: Dear Residents ,

The Green Valley Family in the past few weeks has faced lot of anxious moments and has been burdened with lot of extra work on our shoulders due to the pandemic. 
We are grateful to the members and their families that after scores of Covid positive cases in the 4th week of April, we presently do not have any Covid positive cases in the society and this has only been made possible with the kind cooperation of one and all.
Keeping in mind the current situation and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s SOPs vide its letter no. No. F.2/07/2020/pt file-111/431 dt 29/5/2021 stating as per para 3 as under:- 
“And whereas, the situation of COVID-19 in NCT of Delhi has again been reviewed and observed that, though the number of COVID-19 patients and positivity rate is declining, the situation is still precarious.”
We too know of the above fact, as stated by DDMA above and In furtherance to our earlier advisories on Maids and other helps, the same restrictions shall continue. 
Keeping the long term measure, safety in mind and for convenience, we have scheduled a Covid Vaccination Camp in the Green Valley Society premises on Saturday, 5th June – for age category 18 and above, covishield vaccine priced at ₹1100 per jab.
We advise all those eligible to avail of this facility. 
Keeping the safety of all residents in mind, those who wish to avail of the following services :- Maids, cooks, drivers, vehicle cleaners need to mandatorily get their helps vaccinated at Govt . Centers or at Green Valley Vaccination Camp and submit a copy of the vaccination certificate of all family member and the help to the Green Valley office so as to grant approval of the same.
For residents who are not eligible for vaccination due to any medical reason, exemption from submitting their vaccination certificate will be approved on case to case basis. 
For those who are already availing services of help, they also need to submit their family as well as help’s vaccination certificates by 5th evening to continue availing these services. 
We understand that not all helps will be able to get themselves vaccinated due to various constraints, the Society has decided to subsidise 50% of the vaccination cost for maids and car cleaners at the vaccination drive in the society. Residents are urged to come forward and cover the remaining cost for their domestic helps.
We understand that while the cases have shown a downward trend, our precautions are still to be upheld with maximum strictness so that no further complications may arise. 
We look forward to your cooperation as always and especially in times of this unprecedented pandemic to help all in the community to be safe. We once again request all residents to adhere to covid protocol appropriate behaviour viz. wearing of masks, maintaining social distancing et al. 

With regards

03/06/21, 14:37 - Mommy: Wife ने Husband को msg किया:- ऑफिस से लौटते समय सब्ज़ी लेते आना। और हाँ, पड़ोसन ने  तुम्हारे लिये hello कहा है। 

*Husband* :  कौन सी पड़ोसन  ?

*Wife*: कोई नहीं । मैंने केवल इसलिए msg के अंत मे पड़ोसन का नाम लिखा ताकि मैं sure हो सकूँ कि तुमने मेरा पूरा msg पढ़ा😃 😂😋😉

*अब कहानी में मोड़ है......😳* 
*Husband* :- लेकिन मैं तो पड़ोसन के साथ ही हूँ । तुम किस पड़ोसन  के बारे में बता रहीं थीं ? 

*Wife* :- कहाँ हो तुम ....?    😡

*Husband* : सब्ज़ी बाजार के पास  😎

*Wife* :- वहीं रुको, मैं अभी आती हूँ । .....

10 मिनट में सब्ज़ी बाजार पहुँच कर *Wife ने Husband* को msg किया " कहाँ हो तुम "?

*Husband* :-"मैं आफिस में हूँ । अब तुम्हें जो सब्ज़ी ख़रीदनी  है, खरीद लो......

कहानी में एक और मोड़ आता है
*A big twist is here now*
👇
.
*Wife* : पर मैं तो गुस्से में रिक्शा पकड़कर आ गई और मेरा पर्स भी घर रह गया. सब्जी तो दूर रिक्शा वाले का किराया भी कहा से चुकाऊं ? प्लीज़ जरा जल्दी आओ।

*पति*: बेवकूफ पर्स तो लेकर आना चाहिये था ना। ठीक है मैं आ रहा हूं। *

(सब्जी मण्डी पहुंचकर) कहॉ हो?

*Wife*- घर पर ही हूं, अब सब्जी लेकर सीधे घर आ जाओ। 😋😀😃

*Moral of the story*- 

नारी से तो नारायण नहीं जीत पाये, नर क्या चीज़ है ?

*High Security Alert: *
Beware, one such group is going from house to house pretending to be a Home Affairs Officer. They have the documents and the letterhead of the department of the home ministry and claim they have to confirm that everyone has a valid identity card for the upcoming census.
 They are looting houses. Note that there is no such initiative from the government. Send this to your neighborhood group chat. They are everywhere, and they look presentable. Please alert your family and friends.
 A person comes home and says * I want to take your photo / thumbprint * under the scheme 'Ayushyaman Bharat'. They have a laptop, a biometric machine and a list of all the names. They are showing a list and asking for all this information. It has been pointed out that all this is bogus. Don't give them any information. I am sending this post for everyone's information. Everyone should be alert and tell those who are not in the group.
Always wish you well.

गलतफहमी तुम्हारी है
पिता हूँ मैं तेरा, बेटे
तू मेरी इक निशानी है
है उमड़ा प्यार का सागर
जो इन आँखों मे पानी है
मैं tujhse प्यार करता हूँ
तुझे कैसे बताऊँ मैं
मेरे दिल का, तू टुकड़ा है
तुझे कैसे दिखाऊँ मैं


मेरे दिल को जो तड़पाये
वो खामोशी तुम्हारी है
हाँ तुझसे बात करने को
मेरी साँसे तरसती है
जो दिल का हाल है मेरे
तुझे खुलके बतानी है
मैं tujhse प्यार करता हूँ
तुझे कैसे बताऊँ मैं
मेरे दिल का, तू टुकड़ा है
तुझे कैसे दिखाऊँ मैं

तेरा मुझसे ख़फ़ा रहना

मैं जितना पास आता हूँ
तू उतना दूर जाता है
बिना तेरे न हो सकती
ये मेरी ज़िंदगानी है
तुझे मैं प्यार करता हूँ
तुझे कैसे बताऊँ मैं
मेरे दिल का, तू टुकड़ा है
तुझे कैसे बताऊँ मैं
तुझे मैं प्यार करता हूँ ।

छोड़ दुनिया को तू गया जबसे
कुछ नहीं और मुझको भाता है
तेरा मुझसे

हाथ तेरा था सबके सर पे सदा
पितृ छाया सा तुझको माना सदा
सारी दुनिया मे इक कमी तेरी
कौन कहता था तू पराया है
तेरा मुझसे --------

बीती बातें मुझे सताती हैं,
यादें तेरी बड़ा रुलातीं हैं,
तू सहारा था कितने लोगों का,
तेरी यादों का अब सहारा है
तेरा मुझसे ---------

कैसे भूलूँ तेरी भलाई को
तूने हर इक से जो निभाई वो
कोई दूजा न आज है वैसा
सबके मन में तूही समाया है
तेरा मुझसे ये कैसा नाता है 
तेरा मुझसे ...

15/07/21, 20:50 - Mommy: Starting tomorrow, do not send network pictures, look at the following article to understand.
Please delete all photos and videos of Good morning, Evening and other greetings as soon as possible. Read the following article carefully and you will understand why.
Read all! Please send this message urgently to as many friends as possible to prevent illegal intrusion.
Warning from Olga Nikolaevnas lawyer:
attention! For those who like to send Good morning! Its a beautiful day! Good evening!
Picture people, please do not send these good messages.
Today, Shanghai China International News sent out SOS to all subscribers (this is the third reminder), and experts advise: Do not send pictures and videos of good morning, good night, etc.
The report shows that hackers who attacked China designed these images, and these images and videos are beautiful, But there is a hidden phishing code, and when everyone sends these messages, hackers use your device to steal personal information, such as bank card information and data, and break into your phone.
It is reported that more than 500,000 victims have been defrauded.
If you want to say hello to others, please write your own greetings and send your own pictures and videos so that you can protect yourself and your family and friends.
Important ！ To be safe, please be sure to delete all foreign greetings and pictures on your phone. If someone has sent you such images, remove them from your device immediately. Malicious code takes some time to deploy, so if you take action immediately, there will be no harm done.
Tell all your friends to prevent being hacked.
Say hello in your own words and only send your own created images and videos to greet you, which is completely safe for yourself, your family and friends. Please understand what i mean! Everyone has a bank card attached to their mobile phone, and everyones mobile phone has many contacts. This hack creates a threat not only to yourself, but to your phone, friends and acquaintances as well! This is a brutal
This is a new technique used by terrorists to visit your mobile phone SIM card, so that you become their accomplice!!!
* * * Send this message to as many of your relatives and friends as possible to stop any unauthorised intrusions!!!

15/09/21, 13:42 - Anuj Gupta: I strongly feel virtual platform for education is the need of the system. You are more focused, no distractions etc. 

Even in professional world, I strongly feel that productivity has increased. 

Before Corona we were hardly able to spend 4-5 productive hours at work. Now, easily we can work 12 hrs and these are more productive.

Your best teacher or best mentor is your self acumen. Who teaches anyone, practically you just deliver instructions to get the subject. It is the person who has to learn the skill 😐
15/09/21, 13:44 - Mommy: True. But children are not realising this
15/09/21, 13:46 - Mommy: Till 10th standard virtual platform is very good
15/09/21, 13:46 - Mommy: But after that children need practical knowledge also
15/09/21, 13:47 - Mommy: Office goers can work virtually
15/09/21, 13:47 - Mommy: But again field visit can not be done virtually.

26/09/21, 22:10 - Anuj Gupta: नाराज़ पत्नी ने अपने बैंकर पति से कहा – आप बाहर खाना खिलाने ही नहीं ले जाते ,आज रात का खाना बाहर करेगें..

बैंकर – ठीक है पास के होटल में चलते हैं
पत्नी – नहीं..किसी फाइव स्टार होटल में चलते हैं....

बैंकर  – (एक मिनट के लिए मौन) ठीक है... शाम 7 बजे चलते हैं.

ठीक सात बजे पति-पत्नी अपनी कार में घर से निकले...

रास्ते में – बैंकर बोले जानती हो... एक बार मैंने अपनी बहन के साथ पानीपूरी प्रतिस्पर्धा की थी. मैंने 30 पानी पूरी खाई और उसे हरा दिया....

पत्नी– क्या यह इतना मुश्किल है.??
बैंकर – मुझे पानी-पूरी प्रतियोगिता में "हराना" बहुत "मुश्किल" है।

पत्नी – मैं आसानी से आपको हरा सकती हूँ।
बैंकर – रहने दो ये तुम्हारे बस का नहीं ….!!

पत्नी – हमसे प्रतियोगिता करने चलिये….
बैंकर – तो "आप" अपने-आप को हारा हुआ देखना चाहती हैं.!!?
पत्नी– चलिये देखते हैं…

वे दोनों एक पानी-पूरी स्टॉल पर रुके और खाना शुरू कर दिया ….

25 पानी पूरी के बाद बैंकर ने खाना छोड़ दिया. पत्नी का भी पेट भर गया था, लेकिन उसने बैंकर को हराने के लिए एक और खा लिया और चिल्लाई , “तुम हार गये।”

बिल 100 रुपये आया...

बैंकर -  अब होटल चलें खाना खाने …
पत्नी- नहीं अब पेट में जगह नहीं बची...वापस घर चलो।

(पति-पत्नी घर लौट गये)
और पत्नी वापस घर आते हुए... शर्त जीतने की बात पर बेहद खुश थी....

कहानी से नैतिक शिक्षा....

एक अच्छे  बैंकर का मुख्य उद्देश्य "न्यूनतम खर्च" पर क्लाइंट को संतुष्ट करना होता है….।।

बैंकर हित में जारी🤪..

01/10/21, 17:07 - Anuj Gupta: It is a good exercise. Did you understand how engineer applies to real world.
01/10/21, 17:08 - Anuj Gupta: Engineering is all about understand real world problem, building a mechanism to provide a solution, then develop a solution, then apply the solution and then customise according to the needs and finally assuring the good quality.
01/10/21, 17:14 - Anuj Gupta: Now the next exercise that you would be required to do is :
1. Summarise what was the facility all about?

2. What problem were they intending to solve ?

3. Did you understand how they put in the machines?

4. Did you get to know the solution provided and how did they provide?

5. What were the tools to deliver?

6. What were other departments or functions apart from engineering?

7. How did engineering make the difference, basically quality parameter?

8. Can you create a process flow of the system that you saw?

9. If you are the engineer, how would you increase the production. Think and give ideas?

10. You need to prepare a field survey report and present it to me. Then I will appraise it and tell you what to do with it?

Gulzar: डॉक्टर साब , दो दिनों से लेफ्ट साइड का मोलर बोहोत दर्द कर रहा हैं, रात भर नींद नहीं आई हैं
Dentist: hmmm महसूस तो होता ही होगा कुछ दर्द , धड़कन के आगोश में लिपटी। उस सहमे हुए उक्लीप्तस के पत्तों की दो बूंद  यूंही डाल देते। 
Gulzar: docter वो छोड़ दीजिए,  दर्द बोहोत हो रहा हैं , जरा कुछ कीजिए।
Dentist : दांतो तले रूई के ख्वाब में रात की स्याही सी वो दवा, दांतों के साथ बातें करके किसी पुराने नुस्के की तरह आपको कंबल सी ठंडाई देती हैं। 
Gulzar: डाक्टर आप समझते हैं के क्या दर्द हो रहा हैं ? अंदर, कृपा करके कुछ कीजिए।
Dentist: (looking into his open mouth carefully) हां कुछ अटके हुए अल्फाज हैं दो दातों के बीच, बोहोत पुराने कहावतों की तरह गूंजती ,काली कम्बल समेटे बुझी रात की गवाही दे रही हैं।
Gulzar: डॉक्टर उसेजो कुछ हैं वहां निकालो जल्दी, दर्द सह नहीं जा रहा प्लीज।
Dentist: आसमान के साथ गुफ्तगू करती हुई उस हिलती हुई सी कुर्सी पे आप अपनी पीठ की मुलाकात फरमाए।
Gulzar: क्या ?? क्या करूं? में समझा नही? 
Dentist: ये सुई आपके इस आवै दर्द को गुमनामी की आगोश में लुप्त कराएगी, अटके इन अल्फाजों को एक बादल की कलम से लिखे हुए आंधी की तरह नशेमन तक ले जायेगा ।
उसी उजड़े हुए शहर की खाक से जब आप जागेंगे तब आपको एक बेदखल दात दो लाइनो का इंतजार करते इस ट्रे में पड़ा मिलेगा? 
Gulzar: यानी के?? 
Dentist: जो बातें खुद नहीं समझ सकते हो गुल्लू वो दूसरों के माथे क्यों पोत रहे हो??....  दात निकालना पड़ेगा सड़ गया हैं समझे??

Atleast making some contribution by not bargaining with small time vendors, creating opportunities for surviving family members for job, vocation.

यदि आप समझ जाएं तो मुझे भी समझाइयेगा।
😀😀😀😀😃😃😃😃

किस्सा नं. (1) 

मैं TV पर फिल्म देख रहा था। 
बाजार से लौटी मेरी पत्नी ने पूछा- "क्या देख रहे हो...???" 

"TV पर पड़ी हुई धूल" मैंने उत्तर दिया।

बस तुरंत झगड़ा शुरू हो गया

😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😝

किस्सा नंबर (2) 

मेरी पत्नी ने कहा-

 "आज महंगी चीजें बिकने वाली किसी जगह पर ले चलो।"

मैं उसे पेट्रोल-पम्प पर ले गया

 और झगड़ा शुरू हो गया।

😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃

किस्सा नंबर (3) 

सर्राफा-बाजार से गुजरते हुए मेरी पत्नी ने कहा- "मेरा गले के लिए कुछ दिला दो।"

मैंने तुरंत एक केमिस्ट से स्ट्रेपसिल्स का पत्ता लेकर दे दिया 

और हमारा झगड़ा  शुरू हो गया।

😀😀😀😀😝😝😝😝

किस्सा नंबर (4) 

एक दिन कार से कहीं घूमने के लिए जाते हुए मेरी पत्नी बोली-

 "आज कहीं ऐसी जगह ले चलो जहां मैं बहुत समय से ना गई होउं।"

मैं उसे अपनी मां के घर ले गया

और उसका मेरा झगड़ा शुरू हो गया।

😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀

किस्सा नंबर(5) 
एक दिन पत्नी बोली- "सामने वाले शर्मा जी ऑफिस से आते ही मिसेज शर्मा को गले लगते हैं, आप ऐसा क्यों नहीं करते...???"

"कर तो दूं.. मगर मिसेज शर्मा यदि बुरा मान गयी तो...!!

फिर झगड़ा"..!

अब आप ही बताओ क्या करूँ

😕😣😳😨😩😭😃😃

तो बस ये ही कह सकता हूँ की...
: ये शादी नहीं आसान ,
बस इतना समझ लीजिए ; 

हरी मिर्च की टॉफी है ,
और चूस कर खानी है |

😝😝😝😝😝😝😝😄
 प्रतियोगिता में शर्त लगी थी की
ख़ुशी को 3 शब्दों में लिखो

सब पुस्तके पलटने लगे

मैंने लिखा " पत्नी मायके गई"

भाई साहब,, आयोजक मुझे स्टेज तक उठाके ले गए ,, जाके खूब सम्मान करा और बैंड बाजे से घर तक छोड़ गए।
😄😄😄....

अब घर के बाहर बैठा हूँ,, पत्नी दरवाजा नहीं खोल रही

11/11/21, 00:07 - Anuj Gupta: For the first time in many years, I realised the meaning of true friendship. It was the tragic time period of the month of May when the Covid 2nd wave was on the peak. There was a lot of tension in my house. With God's grace, we were all doing fine but the situation was not the same with our relations. My mother fell ill with some stomach infection and father was over occupied with the business work and managing the household affairs. We really needed someone to help us out in this tough time. My grandmother who doesn't do much of the work at home also refused to cooperate. Now, the only option was to get a maid at home to do household work and prepare the meals for us. It was not safe due to the Covid scare and moreover, we were not in favor. 
I was crying one day and my friend Saanvi saw me. She came to me and asked about things. I could not hold my tears and explained the scenario of things. Saanvi told me that she would help me. She discussed the issue with her mother. She called up Mom and understood her situation. From that day and for the next one week, Saanvi's mother prepared the food for the entire entire family twice a day and sent it in tiffins to us. We tried telling them not to do it but still they did it. Not only this, they sent tea and coffee too for all. We were all overwhelmed with this gesture. 
It was a wonderful experience and for the first time, I realised the true meaning of friendship. Saanvi is so dear to me and we have been friends for the past 5 years. She always used to tell me that one day she would do something great for me. The days had come. She proved it. My mother recovered. She is doing fine now. I am so grateful to my true friend. She made this saying true - A friend in need is a friend indeed. 
Not only this, her mother came to my house too once and asked for the well being of all. At times, when people were keeping to themselves, they came up and helped us. God bless them. Full of gratitude for them.

21/11/21, 01:21 - Anuj Gupta: *The Covid 19 Pandemic and Mental Health - Article on Journal of Social work values and ethics*

Covid 19 has changed the lives of the people across the globe. It has had a huge impact on the entire ecosystem, thereby, impacting the economy, social and cultural life and also various other aspects of human mankind. While human life has changed all over, the state of physical and mental health of people has raised enormous concerns and is now a big center of focus with a lot of work around.

Now, let us give some thoughts to the subject of our ethics and responsibilities as being responsible citizens and social beings. There is a famous saying that the charity begins at home. The first lesson of life is taught at home. The first successful assignment where one delivers required results is carried out at home only. So, when we talk about social work values and ethics in this Covid era, we need to first understand what we are supposed to do first when the discussion is focussed on this mega topic.

To err is a human and a human is a social being. We live in an environment where we are surrounded by people, connected to each other through personal or social or business relationships. This ecosystem is called society and thus, each one of us is driven by social values and ethics. 

Our objective is to understand as to what are we required to follow or deliver in a scenario which is driven by the Pandemic impact.

Our first step towards delivering our responsibilities is to understand what are the DOs and DON'Ts. Are we taking care of these points? Can we keep others healthy if we ourselves are not healthy? Certainly, if we have a disease which can spread, we can contaminate the environment and others can get that too. So, here is the basic ethic to be followed first of all. Wear masks while you are in public. Your safety is primary and that will keep others safe too. If somebody does not wear a mask, ask the person to do so and do not support someone who is not doing so. Do not ever indulge into public interaction without following this protocol.

Next, is to ensure that you get vaccinated. Also, motivate /educate others too to do so. There is a famous saying - Each one teaches one. So follow this and cultivate this chain of vaccinated people. 

Prevention is always better than cure. What is it that we can do to have a healthy environment. The answer is to have healthy people around. Let us increase the awareness to follow methods to stay healthy. Let us make physical exercise and Yoga a regular part of life. These will increase the immunity and less chances of contracting the infection. As a responsible and caring society member, we should focus on these and guide at least our own family members to follow these.

Think of people who have suffered from this disease. Many of them recovered. Many lost lives. Many lost their near and dear ones. Think of the mental agony which these people have passed through. Our values tell us that we should support them to whatever extent we can. Give them mental support at least. If possible, provide financial assistance too to the needy ones if feasible. If you are a business service provider, provide goods/services at economical prices to the people who cannot pay much. If you are an employer, ensure that you do not lay off people as currently the economy is affected and there are not many jobs in the market. So, do not snatch somebody's bread. If you are a medical practitioner, ensure that you do not work to charge more money from the patients. Try to provide best treatments and if possible, give concessions to people who cannot pay much. Same for the hospital owners and diagnostic centers.

A lot of people have been working from home during this pandemic. There have been situations where families are happy to have their dear ones in front of their eyes at home and working. People have developed better understanding. But there have been other things too. The friction has increased in the family members and relationships are affected thereby resulting in deterioration of their emotional bonding. The pandemic has seen splits in the families just because of the people not valuing the safe being of their dear ones as they have been working from home and are in front of their eyes. Our values state that we need to value people and respect their dignity and give them due respect which they deserve. Everyone plays a vital role in the family and no one is more or less important.

It is very important to be a responsible citizen of the country. Our ethics tell us that we should follow the protocols. We should pay taxes on time. Covid has put an immense burden on the Government and they have been doing a lot of work. We should support wherever we can to the best. 

We should promote a green environment. Try to control pollution. Use electric vehicles as much as possible. While the majority of the population uses petrol and diesel vehicles, we should ensure that our vehicles do not emit pollution. Get these serviced regularly. Ensure that you have a valid pollution control certificate for the vehicles.

So, overall, our focus should be to build an environment around us where we can stay healthy, keep others healthy, be happy and keep others happy, eat well, sleep well and let others do so. So, the time is now to consider the whole planet as a family, our society. AND, another important thing, cultivate greenery. Plant trees. If not trees, at least have plants at home. Breathe fresh air. Eat vegetarian food, healthy food. Stop drinking alcohol and educate others too. Have positive thoughts and spread positive vibes in people. Have faith in God and spread positivity around.

Remember, life comes only once. Live it to the fullest, to the best and to the best of your cultural and social values with high morale and ethics. Good Day!

19/12/21, 11:42 - Anuj Gupta: King Harshavardhan was defeated in the battle.

He was handcuffed and taken to the winner king.At that time the winner king was in a happy mood.

The king kept a proposal for Harshavardhan and said, “ If you can answer me a question correctly I will return your kingdom or else leave aside the kingdom, you shall have to remain a prisoner for the rest of your life in my country.”

“ The question is, ' what does a woman want from her man?' You will get a month of time to give the answer.”

Harshavardhan accepted the King's proposal.

He went to various places and met many scholars, preachers, priests, dancers,prostitutes, housewives,maids and many more to know what exactly a woman wants from a man.

If someone said she wants ornaments, the other would say she wants children from her man, another said beautiful house and family, yet another said she would like to have the throne etc. etc.

Harshavardhan was not satisfied with these answers at all.

The month was about to end.

On the other hand, Harshavardhan was unable to collect a satisfactory answer.

Then someone informed that far away,in another country there lives a witch. Only she can give proper answer to this question because she has all the answers.

Along with friend Siddhiraj, Harshavardhan went and met the witch. He asked the question.

The witch said , “ I will give you the correct answer only if your friend agrees to marry me.”

The witch was old and extremely ugly. He didn't want this injustice to happen with his friend.

But to save his friend and the king of his country, Siddhiraj gave his consent to marry the witch and the marriage happened.

The witch then answered Harshavardhan and said, “ A woman wants to be independent so that she can take decisions on her own.”

Harshavardhan liked the answer.

He told this answer to the winner king. The king liked the answer, released Harshavardhan and returned his kingdom to him.

On the other hand, the witch on her wedding night said to her husband, “You have a pure heart. You have sacrificed yourself to save your friend, so, I want to tell you something.”

“Everyday, I look ugly for 12 hours and extremely beautiful for the next 12 hours. Tell me, which look would you like to accept.”

Siddhiraj said, “ That is your decision dear. I have accepted you as my wife,so, I would like you anyway. ”

Hearing this, the witch transformed into a beauty and said, “ You have allowed me to take the decision, therefore, from now I shall always remain beautiful.”

“Actually this is my real look. I had changed my appearance into ugly witch for the ugly people all around.”

*******************************************

The social norms have made women dependent,but, mentally no woman accepts dependence.

Hence,those homes who have given power to the wives are generally happier.

We may not allow the wife to be the head of the house,but, we should atleast release half part of her life, that half part, in which she can openly take her own decisions

रजाई में पड़े रहो
चाय का मजा रहे, 
पकौड़ी से सजा रहे
मुंह कभी रुके नहीं, 
रजाई कभी उठे नहीं
वीर तुम अड़े रहो, 
रजाई में पड़े रहो
मां की लताड़ हो 
बीबी की दहाड़ हो
तुम निडर डटो वहीं,
रजाई से उठो नहीं
वीर तुम अड़े रहो, 
रजाई में पड़े रहो ||
मुंह गरजते रहे, 
डंडे भी बरसते रहे
दोस्त भी भड़क उठे,
चप्पल भी खड़क उठे
वीर तुम अड़े रहो, 
रजाई में पड़े रहो
प्रात हो कि रात हो, 
संग कोई न साथ हो
रजाई में घुसे रहो, 
तुम वही डटे रहो
वीर तुम अड़े रहो, 
रजाई में पड़े रहो
एक रजाई लिए हुए 
एक प्रण किए हुए
अपने आराम के लिए,
सिर्फ आराम के लिए
वीर तुम अड़े रहो, 
रजाई में पड़े रहो
कमरा ठंड से भरा, 
कान गालीयों से भरे
यत्न कर निकाल लो,
ये समय निकाल लो
ठंड है ये ठंड है, 
यह बड़ी प्रचंड है
हवा भी चला रही, 
धूप को डरा रही
वीर तुम अड़े रहो, 
रजाई में पड़े रहो।।

*रजाई धारी सिंह 'दिनभर'*

27/01/22, 17:37 - Mommy: F𝐢𝐧𝐚lly something practical and honest!  Minister of Health of Portugal, Marta Temido delivers the reality:

1. We may have to live with COVID 19 for months or years. Let's *not* deny it or panic. Let's *not* make our lives useless. *Let's learn to live with that fact*.

2. *You can't destroy* the COVID19 viruses that have penetrated cell walls by drinking gallons of hot water -  *you're just going* to the bathroom more often.

3. *Washing your hands is the best method* for your protection.

4. If you *do not have* a COVID19 patient at home, there is *no need* to disinfect your home surfaces.

5. Packed cargoes, gas pumps, shopping carts and ATMs do not cause infection.  *Wash your hands*, live your life as usual.

6. COVID19 *is not a foodborne* infection. It is associated with *infection drops* like the flu. There is *no* demonstrated risk that COVID19 is *transmitted* through food.

7. You *can* lose your sense of smell with many allergies and viral infections. This is *just* a non-specific *symptom* of COVID19.

8. Once home, you *don't need* to urgently change your clothes and shower! Purity is a virtue, *paranoia is not!*

9. The COVID19 virus *is not* in the air. This is a respiratory droplet infection that requires *close contact*.

10. The air is clean, you *can walk* through the gardens, through the parks, just *avoid crowding*.

11. It is sufficient to use *normal soap* against COVID19, not antibacterial soap. This is a *virus, not a bacteria*.

12. You *don't have to* worry about your food orders. But you can heat everything in the microwave if you wish.

13. The *chances* of *taking the
COVID19 *home with the *shoes* is *like being struck* by lightning twice a day. I've been working against viruses for 20 years -  *infections* by droplets do *not* spread like that!

14. You *cannot* be protected from the virus by drinking vinegar, sugarcane juice and ginger! These *are for immunity*, not healing.

15. Wearing a mask for long periods *interferes* with *breathing and oxygen levels*.   *Only* use it in a crowd.

16. Wearing *gloves* is also a *bad idea*; the virus can accumulate on the glove and be easily transmitted if you *touch your face*.  Better to *just* wash your hands regularly.

17. *Immunity* is greatly weakened by *always remaining* in a sterile environment. Even if you eat immunity-boosting foods, *regularly leave your house* for any park/beach. *Immunity is increased* by exposure to pathogens, not by staying home and consuming fried/spicy/sweetened foods and carbonated beverages, and not engaging in physical activity.

28/03/22, 20:18 - Anuj Gupta: Dear all Members,
Please note that videography on AGM dated 27.12.20 in which crucial observation on Corruption ; misapproriation of funds & irregularities in drawings by Secretary was noted are very sensitive. A new dispute on drawings have arisen after Ď.D.A. posted different dwàring on their website last month is evident of Secretary's malafide intention. Moreover it is fact that due to infighting between President & Secretary  has reached to Delhi High Court; D.D.A & RCS . And on top of it Secretary is delaying pending  elections of society due to obvious reasons. 
In view of above reasons members have stopped making payments for FAR extension despite of luring with abnormally desperate discount by Secretary. Maintenance of society is in very bad shape due to infighting in MC. Please do take care.

1.SECRETARY Mr. Bhalla (member of 2 rooms flat of small category, total flats of 2 rooms small category are only 20% of total 300 flats) had earlier LOST ELECTION AND GOT shri  PN Mishra appointed through his tactics of corrupt practices.

2. Secretary is not going to stay in society & is in the process of selling his small flat with his friend of L002 who has been exposed with unfair favour of additional area of 70 Square feet by relative architect Garg as per his confirmation letter already circulated for the knowledge of members.

3.Construction of extended area is at free cost for corrupt MC which is evident that MC members themselves have not made payment till date.

4.There are 300 members & only 53 members (15% of total 300) have been traped by business school with abnormally high discounted selling tricks.

5.Corrupt NRIs in MC have  delayed election  as they know that members will not vote them again due to their rampant corrupt practices on issuance of NOC with extortion of Rs.50000 without receipts.

6. Scam in drawings has also been detected and malor loosers are members from from 3 BHK with Servant Quarters category as there is not a single member in MC in this category. 

Members please be aware of the fatal game plan of the Secretary. We all are at the high risk as member of the society. Do take care and examine the facts before moving forward.

05/05/22, 22:16 - Anuj Gupta: 1000+ words
05/05/22, 22:16 - Anuj Gupta: The summer of 2021, a very different season that year. This year was completely different and brought a lot of painful memories in life. We saw things, came across experiences which we had not felt ever in our entire life time. It was the beginning of April and that was the time when I had a feeling of slight respite that life had begun to stabilize after going through that nightmare of Covid era which had hit the world last year in March 2020. 

People had almost given up using masks and life seemed to be going on at a normal pace and everyone had a thought that Covid was gone and we could actually forget it like another pandemic which was successfully addressed.

Destiny had something else in store for everyone!!!!!!!!!!!

The month of April began and the weather as usual had started becoming hot, temperature rising and everyone thought that this summer will again be like the one which was there 2 years back. Things started changing abruptly and we started seeing a spike in the number of Covid cases. Cases started increasing suddenly and the numbers began to multiply everyday. The 2nd wave of Covid was in. All of a sudden, life changed again. Lockdown was declared and the educational institutes were closed. Companies once again implemented Work from Home but everything seemed to get into the place a bit late. The 2nd wave had crippled the lives of people and a large number of people had contracted the delta virus which was the new strain, a really deadly strain. 

There was hue and cry everywhere , scarcity of oxygen cylinders, shortage of beds in the hospitals, shortage of medicines for treating people and the situation became worse and the Pandemic got fierce. Being in a business family, we were completely dependent on the traditional way of running the business which was characterized   by direct sales and one to one interaction with the clients. There were huge losses but somehow we managed to cover up our expenses and got going with things.

Unfortunately, somebody in the house was contacted with the virus and our Uncle who was staying with us in our house at that time got severely ill. He was found to be delta positive. We had a huge panic at home and everyone was grief stricken. We somehow worked to maintain social distance and started the treatment for Uncle. Everyone else got quarantined and we somehow got alright after 3 days of fever. We took plenty of hot water and vitamins , did yoga and became alright. 

Medical situation became severe and his oxygen level went down. It was a critical situation and there were no beds available anywhere. We didn't know what to do and where to go. Nothing was working for him. This was a time when we actually realised the hardship of life. We used to get phone calls everyday from relatives and friends and they asked for well being but nobody had any solution. We realised that nobody could do anything and it was all up to the Almighty. Then an Angel appeared on the scene. We had a neighbour who stayed 5 houses away from us. To the best of our surprise, he is a person with whom we hardly had any interaction and he was new in the area. One day, my mother was going to the temple and he suddenly asked who everyone was at home and he had not seen anyone in the vicinity since a week. Mother started weeping and narrated the whole hardship the family faced. And now, it was a new chapter of life which began.

That Uncle visited our place and assured his best help. He brought lunch and dinner for everyone in the house and carried on for the next one week. He was working in a Pharma company and he arranged a nurse and doctor who visited our house and provided oxygen arrangement to Uncle who was ill. The doctor started treating Uncle and his oxygen level started stabilising. The medicines started working and it was a real miracle that took place. His family took care of so well and arranged food, medicines , treatment and every essentials and things improved. Uncle was out of danger and health was okay. He had recovered. Everyone at home had a sigh of relief and everyone was also doing fine.

This person had come like an angel and soon we realised that the faith we had in Almighty was really a Universal Truth. God helped us in his form as he became his angel. I wonder at times as to what was his interest in doing all this. Instead he put his life at risk but he had only one agenda - to be a human and extend the best of this help. He lived to his values and did what he thought was right. Do good and help others. No objective of earning any money and only thought was to be a good human. Do we really have such angels in today's materialistic world? It is amazing. All We feel and pray to God is to bless him with all the health, wealth and happiness in his life. The time of this month of April and May was terrible and many members in the family might have struggled to survive but destiny had something else in store for us. Our good deeds paid, our faith in God paid and we came out of that nightmare. 

Life was restored back to normal. Time changed. Business improved. Health improved. But still today when I think about those days, I am not able to believe how we can have such angels among us in today's materialistic world. 

We all at times boast of our relations, our money, our contacts , our influence. Where does all that go when you actually need help in tough situations? There is a famous saying that as and when a ship starts drowning, at first the rats run away from the ship. So, when we are in trouble, is it a fact that the so-called best of the relatives shut their doors first. Are they friends in need or are they friends in good times and just neighbors in bad times who don't open their doors.

This is how this world is. People call up just to let the other person know as to what great they have done in their lives. Who bothers to actually ask someone if they need help any time. Rather they tend to step away when there is a need. So, very few people in this world understand the meaning of real humanity and they come to rescue when someone actually needs it. 

That Uncle did this for us. We shall always be grateful to him for what all he did to us. May God bless him with all prosperity in life.

Sub.: 	Wrongful preparation of defaulters’ list in Green Valley CGHS Ltd.-regarding.

Sir,

A demand for Rs.25,000 was raised vide Green Valley CGHS Demand Letter dated 20.03.2022 for completion related works for payment by 05.04.2022 positively.  It is felt that the names of the defaulters for this demand have not been taken into account while preparing the list of defaulters.  As none of the persons filing their nominations including their proposers and seconders contesting the MC Elections have made any payment in this regard.  Their candidature may, therefore, be cancelled and MC may be asked to prepare a fresh list of defaulters.

Yours sincerely

14/05/22, 14:25 - Anuj Gupta: Remembering the great legend today. He left for his Heavenly abode today one year back. 

He has always been in our thoughts and we shall always follow the path shown by him.

He is our inspiration and we learnt from him as to how one can get to the heights of knowledge in one’s field. It is dedication, passion and hard work and above all, respect for the human values.

No one ever be like him. A man of simple words but he had only one mission and that was to help the human mankind by treating people and curing their health issues.

We still have heavy hearts and still donot believe that he left us. Even today, when we think of him we find him close to us in our thoughts.

God needed him badly as He felt incomplete without him. 

We would always remember him as our Mentor, a great doctor, an Angel and above all, a great human who lived through out to reduce sufferings of people.

Hats off to him. We salute him!🌹🌹🌹

03/06/22, 14:09 - Mommy: *Dr. Milind Kulkarni HR L&T*
Just because I am holding a senior position in HR with L&T, I have been getting many requests from my relatives, friends,  acquaintances, to help their sons or daughters, who have freshly passed out from engineering college, to get job in L&T. The number of requests are huge. So many fresh engineers are unemployed, I could hardly helped only few of them to get job in L&T or in some other companies where I have contacts. I feel bad to say NO to many of the requests or for those whom I can't help. They get disappointed... I can understand. Parents invest their life time earned money just to see their sons or daughters getting degree in engineering.

They think that jobs are easily available for engineers. After interviewing many of them, I can't even tell them  that your son or daughter do not even have minimum required technical knowledge. Getting first class or distinction has become so easy without having fundamental knowledge of engineering. *It's high time for parents to stop running behind engineering degrees.*

*USA produces around 1 lakh engineers per year for a $16 trillion economy.*
*India produces 15 lakhs engineers for a $2 trillion economy.* 
The earlier mass recruiting sector was Manufacturing. It used to recruit from the core branches like Electrical, Mechanical, Civil etc. But, Manufacturing is relatively stagnant at 17% of the GDP. So the core branch placements have become very difficult. 
The more recent mass recruiter was the IT sector. It grew from scratch to almost 5% of the GDP in a short time. IT Employed millions of engineers. 

Now, IT is also saturating. Only good, skilled IT Engineers are in demand. 
If you look at the sectoral composition of Indian economy, most of the sectors do not need engineers. Tourism is 10% of the GDP, does not require engineers. Financial sector, Trade, Hotels and Restaurants do not require engineers. Requirement of engineers in Health, Education, Agriculture is also negligible. 

*More than 50% of the GDP has no role for Engineers.* Still most of Indian youth are becoming Engineers. The situation is not sustainable . 
Demand is low while supply is high. Over and above this, skill level of an average engineer is poor, almost its non-existent in many cases. If we leave aside the top 100–200 colleges, most fresh engineers have no idea of what they studied. Ask a fresh mechanical engineer, can s/he design a simple frame? 

Today the situation is that most engineers are working in a field that has no connection to what they have studied in the college. This is a waste of resources. 
Engineering degree does not come cheap. It costs about 10-15 lakhs. For poor parents, its a huge burden. When their son / daughter is not able to secure a job, they are devastated. 

For the nation, you can calculate the loss. Leave around 1 lakh engineers that NASSCOM says are employable. The rest 14 lakhs have each wasted 10 lakhs of fees. That totals to around $20 Billion. Almost equal to the Government’s spending on healthcare. Over this, there is loss of human capital. 
India needs to replan the whole engineering education system. Goverment need to  cut down on the number of colleges and improve the quality in the rest. 

*Also students should explore other career options than everyone becoming Engineers.* 

When it comes to education, a multitude of options are available today! From Aviation, to Hotel Management, Short Term Programs to big movie production courses, Data science, cyber security, Information Security, Cloud Technology Designing, Indian Armed Forces, Animation and VFX, Digital Marketing, Film Making, Technology Courses like SQL, PHP, Big Data, C, C++, etc. and much more! 
For a majority of courses like these, there are entrance exams too, such as the NATA, CEED, NID entrance, NIFT entrance, NDA entrance, MBA Entrance, Hotel Management entrance, CET, NEET and many more! Here, the right training goes a long way in getting your child admission to their dream institute! *Do you know what are the top career tracks of 2022 other than engineering??* See the following list.
1. Animation, VFX and Multimedia
2. Fashion Design, Event Management and Interior decoration.
3. Aeronautical and Aviation
4.  Film making, Script Writing and Acting.
5. IT, cloud and data science.
6. Networking, information security.
7. Beauty, Modelling and Cosmetology
8. Fitness, dietitian and nutritionist
9. Foreign languages.
10. Music and Dance.

*Please share this with your relatives /friends / 12th pass students and help them in planning their education and carrer appropriately than madly running after engineering admissions!!

15/06/22, 18:25 - Anuj Gupta: If I could change three things in the country, what would those be? This is a million dollar question and I would love to answer it. 

However, before I consider answering this great question, let us do some retrospection of the events and developments/ trends of the past few decades.
 
India is a land of diversity. We have a population of nearly 1.7 billion and have people living in villages and towns, with different mindsets, different cultures, educational backgrounds, 
different religions, different philosophies etc. So, the lives of people are characterized with different challenges and different approaches.

Well, when talking of changing something in such a big demographic, we need to consider the impact of bringing the change. Are people susceptible to change? Is change going to be smooth ?
Every change may have some goal but the results may not be aligned to the desired outcomes.

I think, with all said above, the focus areas change could be Education system, Medical Ecosystem, Infrastructure, Economy, Technology Trends.  

I would like to focus on the Education system, Medical Ecosystem and another subject which explains how to live our lives with leisure and satisfaction. In other words, how to take the best out of 
whatever we do.

Now, the first subject : Education System!

This is a very generic topic and I guess, almost everyone will have diversified thoughts on this. I would like to emphasize that when I say this topic, I am not talking of the way admissions are made in colleges or the courses are structured or how the fee is decided for the courses. My concern is as to how we develop quality and skilled professionals who can be efficient and responsible citizens of the country 
and can help the human mankind in solving the complex problems which could be from the daily life, business world, medical science or engineering etc.

So, let us analyze a bit. When a student enrolls in a school or college, what is their goal? They are taught only one thing in school - get good marks and try to achieve number one position. also, they are 
motivated to focus on their health too. When one joins a college - their goal is to get a good job or enrol in a good degree in higher studies and make money.

Can we think something beyond this. Is earning money the only goal of life? 

Have we ever thought about what we should be doing? We live in a family. We are answerable to our family and have responsibilities. Then we have responsibilities towards our society, our country and then the entire humanity.

Should we not be explained right from day one as when we join our school or college that we should identify one goal of our life? We should be made to analyze what it is that we can do the best?
Which are the complex problems around us that we can solve and accordingly work? Should we not be made to understand that we need not run after money. If we have value in our work, money will
itself come to us.

Instead what we are explained to do - WE ALL SERVE OR MADE TO DREAM TO SERVE A VERY SMALL SEGMENT OF THE SOCIETY WHO JUST USE OUR SKILLS AND MAKE MONEY AND IN
RETURN PAY US SOME PART OF IT!!!!!

I would like to add to the education system a lot more practical study of the environment. Everybody should be educated in a way that one understands how to solve problems and not create problems
for someone to solve. We need to learn how to do things ourselves , instead of depending on others for everything.

Does current education teach us or train us as to how we can follow protocols in our daily life?

Tell me why we do not use a helmet while driving a two wheeler or when we are sitting with someone on it? Why can't we use masks in Covid Era? Why do we tend to overspeed and reach early?
How many of us remember this - BETTER LATE THAN NEVER! There would be numerous examples from all walks of life.

Have we ever focussed on the fact that our body needs healthy food and what do we eat??? Do we ever think of keeping our health in good condition?

So, I would like to bring about this change in Education system. LET EDUCATION TEACH US HOW TO LIVE A SIMPLE, DISCIPLINED AND HEALTHY LIFE AND MAKE US MATURE TO REALIZE 
WHAT COULD BE THE BEST SUBJECT FOR US WHERE WE CAN BUILD A CAREER AND THAT WOULD HELP US AND EVERY ONE!

The 2nd subject that I would want to focus upon is MEDICAL ECOSYSTEM.

In India, the foremost thing a person does when one falls ill is to connect with a doctor. We are very quick to find the most suitable doctor which can treat our ailment. My question is that as and when 
somebody is ill and gets treated and returns back to the normal life; HAVE THEY EVER DONE A RETROSPECTION AS TO WHAT COULD BE DONE TO ERADICATE THIS HEALTH ISSUE SO THAT
IT DOES NOT RECUR?

We are very intelligent to remember the medicines, identify the best specialists but how many of us work to improve our health?

Now the other side of it. Doctors write prescriptions , give the best medicines. How many of them educate the patients that some small steps can help them to avoid health issues?

Should we not have a centralized system where everyone is registered through a unique ID and a health record is maintained. Time to time, they should be sent reminders through SMS or email that they should get their tests done and consult doctors. They should have their health scores available to them. This all can be managed using Data Science and AI.

Last, but not the least, I would like to explain to everyone that we need to understand the meaning of Life. Do not run after money. Have values in your life. Do good and be good to others. Follow discipline 
and live everyday with positivity.

I would like to increase social awareness among people. Think of your neighbors and friends as your families. Take care of your responsibilities. Respect relations, respect everyone! Do good for the people around and overall, become a good human!
15/06/22, 20:07 - Kshitij Gupta: If I could change three things in the country, what would those be? This is a million-dollar question and I would love to answer it. 
India is a land of diversity. We have a population of nearly 1.7 billion and have people living in villages and towns, with different mindsets, cultures, educational backgrounds, 
religions, philosophies etc. 

Before we change something, we need to consider the impact of bringing the change.

According to me, the Education system and Medical System require changes.  
The first subject: Education System!

When I say this topic, I am not talking of the way admissions are made in colleges or the courses are structured or how the fee is decided for the courses.
When a student enrols in a school or college their only goal is to get good marks and achieve number one position. 
When one joins a college - their goal is to get a good job or enrol in a good degree in higher studies and make money.

Can we think something beyond this? Is earning money the only goal of life? 
I would like to add to the education system a lot more practical study of the environment. Everybody should be educated in a way that one understands how to solve problems. 
So, I would like to bring about this change in Education system.

The 2nd topic is MEDICAL SYSTEM!

somebody is ill and gets treated and returns back to the normal life; HAVE THEY EVER DONE AN ANALYSIS AS TO WHAT COULD BE DONE TO ERADICATE THIS HEALTH ISSUE SO THAT

Do we ever work to improve our health?

26/06/22, 12:58 - Mommy: FastTag Scam Alert - झूठ या सच??

आज एक वीडियो देखा, उसमे 2 नवयुवक car में बैठे हैं, तभी एक लड़का उनकी car का windscreen साफ करने आता है... वो bonut पर चढ़ जाता है, फिर हाथ में पहनी हुई घड़ी दिखाता है.. इतने में एक लड़का शोर मचाने लगता है... पकड़ो पकड़ो.

वो बच्चे को नहीं पकड़ पाते... बाद में ड्राइव कर रहा युवक बताता है कि ये नया scam है, जिसमें एक gang छोटे बच्चो को High Tech घड़िया दे देता है.. फिर वो बच्चे आपकी car कि सफाई करने का बहाना मार कर आपके fasttag को अपनी घड़ी से scan कर लेते हैं.. और आपका wallet खाली हो जाता है.

Social media की मेहरबानी से ये वीडियो पूरी दुनिया में वायरल हो रहा है... लोग बिना जानकारी इसे फैला रहे हैं.. और बेवजह डर रहे हैं.

इसका एक ही शब्द में अगर सच जानना है... तो वो यह है की ये वीडियो 'Fake' बनाया हुआ है... ऐसा कोई FastTag scam नहीं होता.

अब आप पूछेंगे कि ऐसा कैसे???

पहले आप Technology को समझिये.

आपकी गाड़ी में एक FastTag लगा होता है... उसमे एक छोटी सी  RFID Chip होती है, एक antenna होता है.... बहुत छोटा होता है... Tag की दोनों layers के बीच में होता है. इस chip में आपकी गाड़ी की जानकारी होती है... और Backend से आपका NHAI wallet, Paytm Wallet या आपकी Bank के account की जानकारी इसमें Coded होती है.

दूसरे छोर पर होता है NHAI.... जो आपसे Toll वसूलता है... हर टोलप्लाजा पर एक scanner होता है.. जो आपके गाड़ी के FastTag को स्कैन करके Payment वसूलता है. जाहिर है Payment NHAI के bank account में ही जायेगा...... इसका अर्थ है Background में NHAI का बैंक account Connect होता है... जो भी पैसा कटेगा वो सीधा NHAI के account में ही जायेगा... अड़ोस पड़ोस वाले किसी अंकल के account में नहीं जा सकता... क्यूंकि इसकी programming ही ऐसे हुई है.

FastTag से पैसा कैसे Deduct होता है??
आपकी car में जो FastTag RFID chip होती है.. वो एक Passive Chip होती है... मतलब उसमे कोई Power source या Battery नहीं connect होती.....जैसे ही आप अपनी car को Toll Plaza पर लगे हुए Scanner के एक ख़ास Radius में लाते हैं... वो scanner आपके RFID पर signal डालता है... और आपका RFID सारी जानकारी Scanner को Transmit कर देता है..... और जितने पैसे कटने होते हैं.. वो Signal आपकी बैंक account या wallet को चला जाता है.

आपके Wallet या Account से NHAI को payment कैसे जाता है??

Backend में NCPI का जबरदस्त  इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर काम करता है.... वही आपके account की जानकारी रखता है... और जैसे ही टोलप्लाजा का Scanner Fasttag को read करता है... अगर Tag सही है, Blacklist नहीं है.. उसमे Balance है.. तो वो NCPI को instruction दे देता है... कि ग्राहक के account से इतनी रकम काटो....

Background में NCPI का UPI या बैंकिंग payment system उतनी रकम आपके Wallet या Account से NHAI के account में transfer कर देता है.

और थोड़ी देर में आपको msg भी आता है... कि NHAI के इस Highway के Toll से आपके इतने रूपए कटे, और इतना balance बचा है.

अब आप सोचिये.... जब आपका RFID coded है, उसे टोलप्लाजा पर लगे scanner के अलावा कोई डिवाइस पढ़ नहीं सकती....... उधर Scanner पर NHAI का account नंबर ही Fixed हो रखा है..... मतलब जो भी पैसा जायेगा वो NHAI के account में ही जायेगा..

ऐसे में कोई बच्चा, पालिका बाजार मे 50 रूपए की 2 दर्जन मिलने वाली फर्जी घड़ी पहन कर.. आपकी गाड़ी के bonut पर Locking Popping करके scan करके आपके account से पैसा उड़ा लेगा?? मतलब आपके हिसाब से यह संभव है 😂😂😂

और अगर यह इतना ही आसान है... तो कोई भी parking में खड़ी गाड़ियों से ना कर लेगा scan???  सुबह से शाम तक पालिका बाजार या खान मार्केट की parking में scan करो.. शाम तक करोड़पति बन जाओ.... बढ़िया स्कीम है भाई लोग 😂😂

इसलिए कहा गया है... दिखावो पर मत जाओ.. अपनी अक्ल लगाओ..... वैसे वो वीडियो बनाने वाले पर सुना है FIR हो गयी है.... पुलिस जल्दी ही उसका FastTag सुजायेगी 😀

06/07/22, 11:19 - Anuj Gupta: We have consulted the doctor and doctor says that we need to see the vaccination card of the dog. If dog is not vaccinated then we need to go for Anti Rabies vaccination. At present he has administered tetanus vaccine to her.
06/07/22, 12:35 - Anuj Gupta: We have seen the vaccination card. It is updated and dog is vaccinated. The owner felt apologetic and said that he would take control of the dog. So we are okay with it and close the subject. We would get the vaccination done though.
06/07/22, 12:37 - Anuj Gupta: However we would urge that all dog owners should submit a vaccination card copy to the society office and a record could be maintained.

06/07/22, 19:51 - Anuj Gupta: Ladies and Gentlemen, we are all like a family and have great respect for each other. 

While I have no further stuff on this as the subject is taken care off and the dog owner has been very courteous and thoroughly gentle. He fully accepted the fault and we appreciate his concern.

Still we would want to see as to what measures we take in terms of defining protocols for the safety of residents though I understand that the MC has been doing a good job and especially in Covid times.

You need to look at various things. Generally I stay silent over things but I have highlighted some other things - the dismantled board on the back gate. It can fall over anyone. Kids stand there to board bus.
The buttons of J block lift donot work. We have to press the buttons continuously and these donot work. 

Please look at these things. These would be helpful.
Thanks

In a Nursery School Canteen... there was a basket of Apples with a notice written over it: 'Do not take more than one.. God is watching '. 
On d other counter there was a box of chocolates. A small child went & wrote on it-"Take as many as u want, God is busy watching d Apples".
Moral: NEVER ACT SMART WITH today's generation..!!.😀

KID:- Why some of ur hair ... white Dad? 
DAD:– Every time you make me unhappy...one of my hair turns white... 
KID:- Now I understand why Grandpa’s hair is completely white.. 
Moral:- Don’t be over smart with 
today's...🤭 

Child: Mummy why Gandhiji had no hair on his head?
Mummy: Because he spoke truth only.
Child: Now I understood why ladies have long hair....
Moral remains the same 😛😛...🤭🙊🤦‍♀️🤷‍♀️😝

26/08/22, 11:14 - Mommy: #आज_वो_घर_पर_है_इसलिए !!! "

घर जाने के लिए निकला। अशांत और विचलित मन लिए सब्जी मंडी पहुँचा कुछ सब्जियाँ खरीदीं।

आज कुछ देर हो गई थी तो घर पहुँचकर खिचड़ी अथवा मैगी बना लेने का विचार चल रहा था। पिछले सप्ताह के एक भी कपड़े धुले नहीं थे अतः 5-6 दिन से एक ही जीन्स को रगड़ रहा था।

एक हाथ से काँधे पर लटके बैग को सम्हालता और दूसरे हाथ में दूध की थैली पकड़े पसीने से तरबतर चेहरा लिए घर पहुँचा। द्वार का ताला खोलना चाहा तो देखा, पल्ले भर भिड़के हुए थे, ताला खुला था। कुछ चिंतित हुआ।

जैसे ही घर में प्रवेश किया तो यूँ लगा मानो स्वर्ग में आ गया हूँ। शंका हुई कि, किसी दूसरे के घर में तो नहीं आ गया ? खामोशी से अंदर के कमरे में गया। फ्रीज खोला तो भीतर की ठंडक चेहरे से टकराई। कोने में अचार रखा हुआ था। मैथी की भाजी बारीक और व्यवस्थित कतरी हुई करीने से रखी थी। सुबह तो फ्रीज में एक ठो बिस्किट पैकेट रखने की जगह नहीं थी, सारा फ्रीज भरा पड़ा था और अब देखो, साफ सुथरी जगह ही जगह थी। धीरे से साथ लाई हुई सब्जियाँ भी फ्रीज में ही रख दीं।

कोने में रखी पानी की टंकी, जिसने हफ्ते भर से पानी का मुँह नहीं देखा था अब, पूरी भरी हुई चमक रही थी। तभी ध्यान गया कि पीछे पीछे अगरबत्ती की खुशबू भी चली आ रही थी, मन को आनंदित कर रही थी।

अपना बैग एक कुर्सी पर पटका तो याद आया कि, सुबह अपना टॉवेल बिस्तर पर ही छोड़ दिया था, देखा तो वहाँ न होकर वह खिड़की के बाहर तार पर लटका सूख रहा था। अलमारी का पल्ला खोला जिसमें बिना धुले कपड़े थे लेकिन अब सारे ही धुले, इस्त्री किए व्यवस्थित रखे थे।

सुबह एक रुमाल मिलकर नहीं दे रहा था और अब, अंदर साफसुथरे रुमाल पर रुमाल की गड्डी रखी हुई थी। सुबह सॉक्स की जोड़ी नहीं मिली तो अलग अलग डिजाइन के मोजे पहनकर निकल गया था लेकिन अब सारे सॉक्स एक स्थान पर उपस्थित पड़े मुझे देख मुस्कुरा रहे थे। लाल, पीली, नीली शर्ट्स बढ़िया हैंगर पर टंगी हुई थीं।

धीरे से टीवी के सामने बैठा, टीवी जिसपर धूल की परतें जम गई थीं अब चमक रहा था और स्क्रीन पर चित्र भी स्पष्ट दिख रहे थे। प्यास लगी तो पानी पीने किचिन में पहुँचा, जिस किचिन में लहसुन, प्याज और न जाने किस किस किस्म की गंध भरी रहती थी, अब  भूख जगा देने वाले भोजन की सुगंध से महक रहा था।

भावनाओं में बहता, बाहर आकर टीवी के सामने एक चेयर पर बैठ गया और अपनी आँखें बंद कर लीं और सोचने लगा। फिर आँखें खोलकर अपनी ही बाँह पर चिमटी ली कि, कहीं ये सब स्वप्न तो नहीं। तभी गरमागरम पकौड़ों की प्लेट और भाप निकलती चाय किसी ने सामने टेबल पर रख दी। भीतर का अहम जैसे जर्रा जर्रा होकर बिखर गया। जब थककर आता था तो जैसे तैसे दही चावल पर गुजारा कर लिया करता था और आज भाप निकलती स्वादिष्ट चाय और गरम पकौड़ों का आनंद ले रहा था। न चाहते हुए भी आँसू की दो बूंदें आँखों से निकलकर गालों पर बह निकलीं। फिर खुद को सम्हाला तो अहसास हुआ..... 

" आज_वो_घर_पर_है_इसलिए !!! "

संसार के सारे सुख और समृद्धि की प्रदाता वो...
किसी के लिए माँ,
किसी की पत्नी,
किसी की बहन,
तो
किसी के लिए बेटी है।

आप कितने ही बड़े हों, महान हों लेकिन सुखमय जीवन के लिए किसी न किसी रूप में एक स्त्री आपके जीवन में अतिआवश्यक है।

वो किसी भी रूप में हो मगर, घर को घर वही बनाती है।🙏

30/08/22, 21:43 - Mommy: 😳एक औरत हाथ में हथौड़ा लिये, अपने बेटे के स्कूल में पहुंची !!

😜और चपरासी से पूछ्ने लगी :-- 

😳"शुक्ला सर" की क्लास कौन सी है?"??

😜"क्यों पूछ रही हैं?" हथौड़े को देखकर,चपरासी ने डरते हुए पूछा ???

😳"अरे वो मेरे बेटे के क्लास टीचर हैं ।" हथौड़ा हिलाते हुए,वो औरत उतावलेपन से बोली।

😳चपरासी ने दौड़कर शुक्ला सर को खबर दी, कि एक औरत हाथ में हथौड़ा लिये आपको ढूंढ रही है। 

😜शुक्ला सर के छक्के छूट गये। वो दौड़कर प्रिसिंपल की शरण में पहुंचे। 

😳प्रिंसिपल तत्काल उस औरत के पास पहुंचा,और विनय पूर्वक बोला, "कृपया करके आप शांत हो जाईये।"

😳 मैं शांत ही हूं।" वो औरत बोली।

😳प्रिंसिपल: - आप मुझे बताईये, कि बात क्या है??

😳औरत: - बात कुछ भी नही हैं। मैं बस शुक्ला सर की क्लास में जाना चाहती हूं।

😜प्रिंसिपल:- लेकिन क्यों?

😳औरत:-  क्यों, क्योंकि मुझे वहाँ उस बेंच की कील ठोकनी है, जिस पर मेरा बेटा बैठता है।

😳क्योंकि वो स्कूल से तीन दिन में तीसरी पेंट, फाड़ कर आया है।!!😂😂😂😩😩😅😀😀

06/09/22, 12:30 - Anuj Gupta: Cyrus Mistry was sitting on the rear seat, the two people that survived were sitting in front with seat belts on. 

There were four people in the vehicle, of which two, including Mistry, died on the spot. The other deceased person has been identified as Jahangir Binshah Pandole. 

Those injured — identified as Anahita Pandole, a top doctor at Breach Candy Hospital, (who was driving the car) and Darius Pandole, the managing director and CEO of JM Financial Private Equity — have been shifted to a hospital. 
Indian Express

Airbags are of no use if seat belt is not strapped which is the first line of defence. 

Air bag is the second line of defence only if the first is complied

If you do not lock sitting chair seat belt properly Air bag will not open

All the cars have rear seat belts as per government regulation, but very few people use them, it is an illusion that the rear is very safe. 

During the time of crash the person behind is sometimes thrown at a force of 40G (40 times the gravity, which means the person weighing 80kgs will be like 3200kgs). 

If the front passenger is wearing seat belt and rear passenger is not, during the time of crash the front passenger is likely to be severely injured or killed due to the rear passenger falling with a weight of an elephant. 

Totally surprised to hear this. Guys - We pay for seat belts - why not use them and be safe. 

Pl follow safety rules when you are travelling.

Not wearing helmets, seat belts etc. can cause such a big havoc. It is just a matter of changing thought process and follow rules. 
Rules are made for our safety , not to put us in a space where we tend to redefine our own rules.

18/09/22, 21:27 - Anuj Gupta: I have been thinking of writing about this since long now. Putting some thoughts together. 

Most of us have passion for music in one way or the other. While I have always been passionate of exploring new things, music has been an integral part of my life. I am a singing passionate and very keen to innovate new dimensions in my singing.

My singing journey has spanned for nearly 4 decades now. Last few years, I have really touched my inner soul and taken singing passion to new heights. My Ideal is Kishore Kumar. While I have approximately sung and recorded 1500 songs till date, this seems to be an unending passion.

Singing acts as an Energizer, it acts as a Meditation, it takes me close to Almighty, it takes out all negativity and fills me with positive energy. It does wonders to health. It helped me drastically to control my diabetes and kept me strong against the current pandemic.

My message is that we should live our life with passion, identify our passion and do things which strengthen our inner soul. We earn money, we manage life, we take care of our responsibilities, however, we need to listen to your inner soul too. 

Take a break, think , analyze and look for bigger goals in life. Ultimate objective is to live a big life. Long life is not sufficient, make it big. Singing is Eternal. I dedicate my passion to Kishore Kumar songs. These have kept me ever Energetic and kept going good!!!!

26/09/22, 21:14 - Anuj Gupta: Please start using credit card for the shopping in malls as you get lot of benefits. There are discounts, cash backs and points accumulation. Also it builds your credit profile. There is no point in shelling out cash or giving away account money. Accumulated money gets interest and can be used in need. Credit card gets you 45-50 days credit period. 
Only thing to take care of that you should know the limit to which you should use credit , donot spend beyond the capability as the money needs to be returned back too.

29/09/22, 11:41 - Anuj Gupta: 1. An interesting story and a real one, I was just taken back in the past. Do give a glance. Please bear with me for 2 minutes reading this.

2. The summer of 1984 and this was a wet afternoon with showers cooling down the temperature.

3. The 2nd half of the school was called off as the teachers got busy in some assignments.

4. Our PT teacher Mohan Duttji took us to the play ground and organised a race among all students.

5. We all stood in a row and as soon as he gave the signal , we started running. 

6. We had to touch the other end of the ground and come back to the start point.

7. I was a bit weak and soon got tired. 

8. Then I started looking at as to who was running beside me. I started competing with him to move ahead. But he raced ahead.

9. Then I started staring at all in the race and started thinking that there were so many ahead of me. 

10. I thought of running ahead of each of them and it started bothering me as to why so many were ahead of me.

11. Now my race was focused on moving ahead of each of them and I was looking at everyone.

12. Surprisingly, each one of them moved ahead of me and I was amongst the last ones who returned when the race closed. 

13. Out of 20 , I ranked 18 or 19. Only ones who were lethargic or fat were behind me.

14. I had lost the race.

15. I came home, cried and told the story to all.

16. He smiled at me and said……

17. “You had lost the race in the starting itself. You were only and only looking at others, comparing etc.”

18. “You lost your focus, your energy and got into stupidity of looking at others and comparison. This is where you lost the time.”

19. Moral of the Story: Focus on your path, ensure it is right, preserve energy, donot compare, donot get carried away by others’ achievements. 

20. Enhance your strength, reduce distractions and have a goal. Then, only you will win the race else you will lose it.”

While the whole country was enjoying the festival , we had a lot more coming up. 
The Goddess of Beauty blessed me with her blessings and the connection of my soul. An exact simile beauty entered our lives and enlightened it . 
Life changed after this. The little Angel has kept us happily, ever positive and made us realise that a power is always with us in her form!

24/10/22, 11:12 - Anuj Gupta: Human Relationships is a big subject and when it comes to analyzing this, it gets cumbersome to put thoughts together and arrive at a concrete analysis about what is what and how things change.

We all grow up, changes happen in life. People come and go, life goes on. One thing that draws a lot of attention at different times is how to cultivate and manage relationships?

Two brothers do not have a similar thought process. Couples have different perceptions. Parents and children have a generation gap. Friends do not arrive at a consensus. Business relationships, again different deliverables and expectations, hardly these are matched. Social life, again mismatch. Everywhere, you find something or the other does not align.

So, here are my questions. 

- Why can't relationships be freed of expectations and one big issue which is Egoism? 

- Is it so difficult to respect other people's thoughts and values?

- Why do we tend to become so judgemental and not leave things as they are?

- Why do we not simplify our relations and be original? Why so much show business?

- How many times do we tend to do self retrospection?

I think everyone needs to understand that humans are social beings and everyone is bonded to someone or more people in life.

We need relations to be with us in good and bad times. Giving up a relationship is easy , however difficult to build one. At the other end, what is the point if there is no respect in the bond?

Can everyone as a human simplify one's life and make life prosper by letting people know or understand that they care for them and respect them. Dynamics of the entire world will change!

Welcome the thoughts from all!
24/10/22, 11:22 - Anuj Gupta: It is good to be introvert. Let the actions and achievements speak rather than words and they actually do. I have realised over the years that in being extrovert, people lose their focus and end up over committing and delivering less. If we commit less and deliver quality, people value us more. Very correctly said, introverts are selectively social. Certainly, we all have a periphery around us which we call as Circle of Influence. Only few should be coming in. Let the book be understood by its cover first and only when one wants to read, then only open its pages. Why to keep the book open everytime?

27/10/22, 10:50 - Anuj Gupta: The world is round. Whatever begins at some point of time, comes back to the same point later at some stage. 

Lot of relations in life are lost in the journey , some voluntarily and some due to reasons beyond control. 

I have seen the reversal. People do tend to come back and continue from where they left. Is it a good thing to take a step back and re-bridge or we look forward to move on in life.

Can a broken bridge be rebuilt? If yes, will it have the same strength as it had originally?

What is the assurance that it will not break again?

Retrospection?

Everyone tends to invest in life where one can get fruitful results, whether it is money or time.

What is the point of beating in the bush? After all, we are all lonely when it comes to moving in life and performing our roles and responsibilities.

31/10/22, 13:46 - Anuj Gupta: Thought for today !

Change is an integral aspect of life Whether it is a change of place, change of status, change of locality, change of relations or anything else, the only thing which is constant in this world is change.

Gain and loss is a part of life, that is how the things work in life. Anything and everything that belongs to someone, may or may not stay forever along! Then what is it that lasts forever? A lot of retrospection required!!!

Human relationships are an ever happening subject and these never fade away with anything. Time changes, world changes, these keep going their way,

One beautiful relation is Friendship. We get friends in life, we get new dimensions, new experiences, new learnings and above all, we are empowered with the Godly power that blesses us every day, every moment and fills us with positivity.

I have diversified thoughts in this arena!

What is the meaning of friendship? Do we get REAL friends in today's world? What do we expect from friends? What if our expectations are not met? How do money matters get aligned with friendship?

Friend in need is a friend indeed. If someone is unable to help, does it go away? Difficult to define? 

My definition is that Friendship is a relationship all above the dynamics of the entire World's economy and ecosystems. Someone who teaches you how to live life to the best, shows you the path to become successful and gain prosperity in life, someone who does not cry with you but teaches you how to come out of pain and shed off the tears, someone who may not laugh with you but teaches you as to how to cherish each and every moment of life, keep your smile intact at every moment, someone who may not give you money but shows you the way to earn it with honesty, someone who might not hold your hold in crisis, but walks along and ensures that you do not fall, someone who transforms you into a contented person and helps you to take the best out of life is a FRIEND.

Nobody walks alone and everybody never stays along! Friends empower us!

So, we should understand this and analyse. Thoughts welcome from all!

01/11/22, 09:57 - Anuj Gupta: Here is a very important and integral aspect of our lives and it is more of one’s personality traits viz. Contentment. Let us talk about it and put thoughts together!

Have we ever thought as to how we could stay contented? We go through the journey of life, come across different stages, different people and pass through different situations. We all at some or the other point of time talk about what we have, what we lack and what we need further. Do we ever have this answer that one has got enough?

I think this is an ever progressing and unending debate. If we get contented, we shall stop thinking of growth. If we never get contented, we shall ever crib. However the question is then as to how to be happy because both ways we lose our cool and always get into circles of looking for one thing or other.

Let us take a tangent here. Let us answer one question to ourselves and not the rest of the world. Who is managing the entire world? Do we control anything in this world? We often tend to think that we control too many things but is it actually so?

I think we are all connected to each other one way or the other and some supernatural power governs us. What we think that we control is actually not in our hands. It is a part of sequences which get created as a result of our actions and decide the destiny. Input proportionates the output.

So, my thought would be that we should live the life to the best, every day is a new day and every moment brings a fresh lease of life. We need to cherish the time. Time never stops. So go with time. Be thankful to the Trinity for giving every moment to us and take the best out of it.

Recently I learnt a new thing. Get into get togethers with people who understand you and you get to know what they look for. Go for an outing, smile, laugh, eat, dance and spend quality time. Learn from them about their good things and improve in self. Socialism if managed well can get us great avenues and opportunities to progress better in life.

Contentment is nothing but a state of your mind. It is connected to your heart and soul. It does not come by spending money or building status or making the world admire you. It comes from within your soul , it is a message that your inner self gives you and fills you with happiness and positivity.

Start loving and valuing yourself, get into things which you are passionate about, eat the food of your choice, visit places you live to go and bridge with people who make you feel at home.

Life will become ever charming, contented, blissful and king size.

Thoughts from all!

05/11/22, 10:53 - Anuj Gupta: Need a retrospection. What was/has been the logic behind marks/grades. These donot certify a person to be intelligent or successful , that is a different subject. 

Only rational behind marks is to set a benchmark so that one can learn the subject well and explain the knowledge. It teaches us to adapt to the process of putting in efforts to get the best out of your subject and that is what continues through out. Now it depends on the person how one takes it forward in life.

At every aspect in we life we tend to assess ourselves or others as and when required. A person who has had the attitude to score high would generally tend to shine (subject to circumstances definitely) as compared to the one who didnot bother. 

Try to get the point as to what one needs to learn in life as to how to succeed and move ahead and that is something to be cultivated in initial stages of life in one and marks tend to build up that.

07/11/22, 23:29 - Anuj Gupta: Thought for today!

I have been writing about various subjects. Life is versatile. So many new things happen from time to time, things change, times change, a lot changes. However, certain aspects of life remain unchanged. We talk about Values, Relations, Emotions and various other subjects, there is one topic that needs focus as it is an ever ending , everlasting and ever loving part of life for everyone. Let us talk about Friendship.

One day, I was dreaming of connecting my inner soul to the power of the Almighty. I just happened to come out of my inner self and had a look over the world integrating with the divine power of my soul. I found that the entire world is big, versatile and has so many colors. I realised that the world is colorful, life is colorful and it all depends on an individual as to how one fills life with those colors. I decided to take a long walk and analyse the different facets.

One grows up, gets into relations, progresses in life. earns money, status and migrates from one stage of life to another stage and thus the journey goes on. I somehow felt that at every stage, a green line goes along and shadows its glory over one and makes it beautiful every moment.

I retrospected to find out what  it was. After a long analysis, I found that It was FRIENDSHIP. 

I asked the Almighty as to what it meant for the humans. I was wondering as in a world of diversity, what was the need and place for this newly explored green aspect of life? 

There was silence for some time and then I could hear the voice of God.

God said, "Look My child, you are born in this world and you have a journey to carry on, accomplish various tasks every moment, every day and in every phase of life. There are moments when you tend to take a break, go back and think ............What have you been doing, what do you need to be happy, how to explore your soul and realise your power, how do you come out of your sufferings, how to fill your life with happiness, how to take the best out of life in its entirety?????"

I was lost in thoughts. I couldn't get an answer. Only thing I could think was that the Almighty should stay with me every moment, shadow me, guide me and fill me with positivity every moment!!!!!!!!

God smiled and said, "I know what you are thinking..............That is the reason I was inspired to create FRIENDSHIP. I have been with everyone at all times and I sent my message to you through my Angels whom I defined as Friends. Now it is upto you to analyze and find out who your real Friends are!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

I got awake and understood the gist of life. Life changed!!!

I dedicate this to this group and I am blessed and empowered in entirety. Kudos to all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

30/11/22, 09:22 - Anuj Gupta: SOME SOCIAL RULES THAT MAY HELP YOU:

1. Don’t call someone more than twice continuously. If they don’t pick up your call, presume they have something important to attend to;

2. Return money that you have borrowed even before the person that borrowed you remember or ask for it. It shows your integrity and character. Same goes with umbrellas, pens and lunch boxes.

3. Never order the expensive dish on the menu when someone is giving you a lunch/dinner.

4. Don’t ask awkward questions like ‘Oh so you aren’t married yet?’ Or ‘Don’t you have kids’ or ‘Why didn’t you buy a house?’ Or why don't you buy a car? For God’s sake it isn’t your problem;

5. Always open the door for the person coming behind you. It doesn’t matter if it is a guy or a girl, senior or junior. You don’t grow small by treating someone well in public;

6. If you take a taxi with a friend and he/she pays now, try paying next time;

7. Respect different shades of opinions. Remember what's 6 to you will appear 9 to someone facing you. Besides, second opinion is good for an alternative;

8. Never interrupt people talking. Allow them to pour it out. As they say, hear them all and filter them all;

9. If you tease someone, and they don’t seem to enjoy it, stop it and never do it again. It encourages one to do more and it shows how appreciative you're;

10. Say “thank you” when someone is helping you.

11. Praise publicly. Criticize privately;

12. There’s almost never a reason to comment on someone’s weight. Just say, “You look fantastic.” If they want to talk about losing weight, they will;

13. When someone shows you a photo on their phone, don’t swipe left or right. You never know what’s next;

14. If a colleague tells you they have a doctors' appointment, don’t ask what it’s for, just say "I hope you’re okay". Don’t put them in the uncomfortable position of having to tell you their personal illness. If they want you to know, they'll do so without your inquisitiveness;

15. Treat the cleaner with the same respect as the CEO. Nobody is impressed at how rude you can treat someone below you but people will notice if you treat them with respect;

16. If a person is speaking directly to you, staring at your phone is rude;

17. Never give advice until you’re asked;

18. When meeting someone after a long time, unless they want to talk about it, don’t ask them their age and salary;

19. Mind your business unless anything involves you directly - just stay out of it;

20. Remove your sunglasses if you are talking to anyone in the street. It is a sign of respect. Moreso, eye contact is as important as your speech; and

21. Never talk about your riches in the midst of the poor. Similarly, don't talk about your children in the midst of the barren.

22. After reading a good message try to say "Thanks for the message".

APPRECIATION remains the easiest way of getting what you don't have.
30/11/22, 09:49 - Mommy: Thanks for the message 👍🏻

06/12/22, 17:49 - Anuj Gupta: *Action taken by Competent Authority (RCS) on Fraudulent Meeting & false minutes of GBM in Teen Murti  by    Secretary.*
Dear Members,
Stage managed AGM meeting conspired by Secretary again in  Teen Murti overruled by Registrar and ordered for holding the AGM in Society’s premise. This truth was hidden by secretary in his communication for changing the AGM venue from Teen Murti to society’s premise but members have now understood his whole game plan. Unapproved Minutes of GBM/ AGM held in December 2020 and October 2021 circulated by Secretary are also deemed to have been cancelled.
Order issued by the Registrar did not share by Secretary for obvious reasons to cover his malafide intentions involving corruption in F.A.R. 
Moreover another scam is unearthed where unelected President has got extra area from share of 150 flats with servant quarters who have paid higher amount of LAND MONEY.

Today in the evening at 5 pm I have seen him entering the gate and driving at very high speed. It may not only cause accident to others but he himself can be injured seriously. Guard has told only the flat no, not the name. Guard has told that he has been told about this many times but did not care. I can only pray for the safety of GV residents and for HIM as well.

However, we would surely be willing to visit your facility some other time with different groups.

Well, everyone has a different perception and a different definition of success.
For some people, making good money from a job or a business is a success story.
For someone, getting good marks in the exams is success.
For someone, treating the patients well and curing them is success.
For someone, leading a team to stand at the top of the race is success.
And so on...

I think, from where I would want to look at it, I would define success as a result of actions which contributed or led directly or indirectly to solve a complex problem(s) and improve someone's life.

Failures act as catalysts and at the same time as a source of information pool which apprise one to gather and analyse data to refine the actions and succeed next time!

11/01/23, 23:12 - Anuj Gupta: Did you get some insight to the subject of internships 🙂
11/01/23, 23:21 - Kshitij Gupta: I am thinking of building some projects this semester and do internship in the next one
11/01/23, 23:31 - Anuj Gupta: So what are the topics.are these real world issues or something abstract kind
11/01/23, 23:35 - Kshitij Gupta: 1. A project to build a platform for university to connect students with alumni. Basically a linkdIn clone for student-alumni interaction.
2. A research backed by a project to analyze the impact of edtech companies in the covid era.
11/01/23, 23:36 - Kshitij Gupta: I was also thinking of building a dashboard which analyzes the recent layoffs and shows which skills are relevant in industry
11/01/23, 23:37 - Anuj Gupta: These donot impress, too bookish projects and too much non industry oriented😐
11/01/23, 23:38 - Anuj Gupta: Consider a scenario. A big IT conglomerate has plethora of new projects coming up that need to be delivered. 

There are tight deadlines may be in terms of deliverables as well as time span.

Now visualise as to what they look for in terms of manpower?
11/01/23, 23:38 - Anuj Gupta: The issue is that you are thinking as per what you think is good. Gentleman, what is your homework in terms of what industry people are looking for ?
11/01/23, 23:38 - Anuj Gupta: 😇😇
11/01/23, 23:39 - Anuj Gupta: You may write big books but what if no body reads them 🤪
11/01/23, 23:40 - Anuj Gupta: I am only writing as you asked me. You need to come out of that shell which you have created around you. Come out if the world of dreams and look at real world. 🙂
11/01/23, 23:41 - Anuj Gupta: At least go and find out as to what industry people want 😐
11/01/23, 23:49 - Kshitij Gupta: Hmm. Let me think about it.
11/01/23, 23:58 - Anuj Gupta: This is too generic. Enough gyan available on Google
12/01/23, 00:08 - Anuj Gupta: Money is earned by accomplishing a task. Big money is earned by big tasks.

Tasks could be problems to be solved, simple routine works like data entry etc , commercial transactions , medical science or so many subject areas in the world .

Now you know by know your strengths. You are a data scientist.

Narrow down your thoughts to the world of data science and expand your reach to the existing industry problems to be solved by data science.

Reach out to the industry people who can tell what are the problems.

Reach out to techies who solve these problems.

Make your list of who all you can talk to.

Talk to them and find how they solved them and what they did.

Prepare your data pool.

Figure out some core issues which are the needs of the time.

Work out your project plan.

Build the projects.

Get these assessed from industry experts as well as academic experts.

Build your profile and update these there.

That is it!🙂
12/01/23, 00:08 - Anuj Gupta: All this has to go along with course curriculum. Donot forget that. That is core and this is second stream to be developed!
12/01/23, 00:23 - Kshitij Gupta: hmm right
12/01/23, 11:20 - Mommy: Sadly a new scam: 
Just now my friend  received a call from 912250041117 asking him  to press 1 if he had vaccinated.  He
 pressed 1. Immediately the phone was blocked 🚫 and his phone has been hacked. So be careful when you get similar calls. Put this in your group chat.

16/01/23, 23:05 - Anuj Gupta: A violinist played for 45 minutes in the New York subway.  A handful of people stopped, a couple clapped, and the violinist raised about $30 in tips. 

No one knew this, but the violinist was Joshua Bell, one of the best musicians in the world. In that subway, Joshua played one of the most intricate pieces ever written with a violin worth 3.5 million dollars.

Two days before he played in the subway, Joshua Bell sold out a Boston theatre, and the seats averaged about $100. 

The experiment proved that the extraordinary in an ordinary environment does not shine and is so often overlooked and undervalued.

There are brilliantly talented people everywhere who aren’t receiving the recognition and reward they deserve. But once they arm themselves with value and confidence and remove themselves from an environment that isn’t serving them, they thrive and grow.  

Your gut is telling you something. Listen to it if it’s telling you where you are isn’t enough!  

Go where you are appreciated and valued. 

Know Your Worth.
17/01/23, 13:27 - Anuj Gupta: It is a joyous journey in metro 🚇😇😇
17/01/23, 13:29 - Mommy: Good. Enjoy 👍🏻
17/01/23, 15:28 - Anuj Gupta: Here is the story of a wonderful person. 

- The person is eldest among all the siblings.

- The person is emotionally matured since early age as was made to understand responsibilities.

- The person never had big ambitions. 

- the person was always realistic and had grounded approach towards life.

- The person never had any greed for money in any facet of life.

- The person always valued relations.

- The person stood by the needy as and when required in the family and even the extended ones to the family or even outside world.

- The person never got away from the responsibilities.

- The person always looked at positive side of life.

- The person is loved by everyone who is matured and who understands human behaviour.

———————————————————————-

@@One day an Angel comes in the dreams of this person. The person asks the Angel as to where the person stands in terms of achievements and establishing the goals and duties of life and developing one’s followings. 

@@The person wants to know as to how many people stand there to support this person in need?

Angel smiles. 

The Angel asks the person to turn around and see the queue. The person is shocked. The queue for this person is very small and there are long queues for others whom this person helped.

The person questions the Angel as to why it is so?

Angel smiled and asked a question.

“Have you observed finely as to what happens when you prepare tea ☕️?”

Person said they drink it and get heat, good comfort, good health etc.

Angel asked “what happens to the ☕️ leafs?”

Person said these were exhausted and finally thrown away!!

Angel smiled and asked if the person got the answer!!!!!

It was too late for the person to learn things as the person had lost the race and everyone was ahead and there was no one to help this person. 

All the leafs were consumed by others drinking the tea ☕️ and when this person needed the heat, there was no milk and the tea or 🍃 leafs.

What is the message?

- It is good to be a human as we are blessed by the Almighty!

- It is better to have a human heart 🫀 along with being a human soul.

- It is great to help others in need !

- However it is very important to understand the difference between the needs and the desires to use someone !!!!

Rest is all theory of books!

01/04/23, 08:50 - Anuj Gupta: *Teacher, Trainer, Tutor, Mentor*

Teacher teaches in class, handholds the student from start of the curriculum to completion. Imparts knowledge. Teacher is the guide to venture into a new territory.

Trainer is the one who explains a subject in particular from the usage aspect in professional world. He converts the bookish content to the use in the practicality.

Tutor is the one who helps to build the knowledge from the aspect of already studied curriculum and helping to provide more clarity.

Mentor is the one above all these. He or she does not teach any curriculum. They handhold the student, walk along and mentor to learn in totality as to how to solve problems and build solutions in the subjects.

You are a MENTOR.

02/04/23, 19:20 - Anuj Gupta: Thought for this week

1. Life is full of experiences, learnings, ups and downs. Each of us strives for the best in life. 

2. However, everyone has had different paths and their own ways to do things. 

3. I have felt over the years that nobody in this World is born perfect. 

4. Success comes through a set of well defined and strategized actions. 

5. Perseverance and optimistic approach is a must in any facet of life. 

6. The question that arises is as to what is the foremost requirement as and when we undertake a challenge or an assignment or a project or a responsibility or whatever we might call, basically something that needs to get the results delivered.

7. Is this - Knowledge, Strategy, Energy, People management, Crisis management or Capability to lead?

8. I think nobody has ever had a complete answer. Gist is that as and when we move ahead, we devise our path, overcome the thresholds, break barriers and get the results.

9. One question that arises here : What is the role of a Guide? 

10. These could be parents at home, teachers in schools, professors in colleges, tutors in institutes, managers in offices etc.

11. So, in a nutshell, we need someone(s) to do the hand holding, Isn't it?

12. So, here is my analysis that I have gathered over years of learning and working.

13. We have Teachers...We were taught that teachers teach us in schools and colleges....
..................We have Tutors....We were told that tutors supplement our school or college education if that is not sufficient to understand the subjects.. 
..............We have Trainers....We were told that the trainers are the people who deliver knowledge for a particular subject(s) in the professional world...
...............We have Technologists....We have been seeing that the technologists work to make lives easier by solving complex problems ...  

14. WHOM DO WE NEED THE MOST?

?
?
?
?
?

15. I used to go around and ask people in my college days , and everyone gave different answers. Many people didn't get my question. They just ignored me 🙂 

16. Years later, I got the answer....

17. We get all these people at different stages in different forms. They all help us to learn about the world.

18. However.....the person that we NEED the most in our lives and most of the times, we donot realise the value of this person...

19. Who is this person?

20. Years of research gave me this answer!

WE NEED A MENTOR.....
 
21. How many of us actually understand what a Mentor means?

22. A mentor does not teach, does not train, does not give download of knowledge, does not develop our skills....

23. A mentor is the one who walks along, explains us how to handle problems of life, guides us to convert tasks into well defined actions, convert challenges into interesting projects, helps to convert failures into learnings and move on the path to SUCCESS!

24. Many of us might agree that Mentoring holds the key!

25. Happy Mentoring!

03/04/23, 10:41 - Anuj Gupta: 1. I am quite adapt to collecting data and doing analysis. 

2. One fine day, I decided to talk to my Subconscious and analyse various aspects of the way things go along in life.

3. We were walking beside. My subconscious asked me as to what was my concern🤔.

4. I would address the subconscious as S.

5. I said that we should talk about sufferings. 

6. S said that He didnot understand this word and wanted me to explain.

7. I said something that gives a unpleasant impact to the heart and mind is suffering.

8. S smiled. 

9. S asked me as how it affected my inner soul?

10. I said that I felt as if I was losing a lot and missing things.

11. S told me that I needed to look at it from a different angle. We suffer in life because our expectations and the resultants donot align. 

12. I was silent for a while. 

13. I asked S as to why do we expect?

14. S again got silent for a while. Then asked me if I had ever analysed as to how a plant grows. 

15. I said that we plant a seed in the soil. Then we put water in it. Then it gets sun light. Then it goes through changes of weather and it grows. Then it gives fruits etc.

16. Then S asked if this plant 🪴 expects that it gives fruits despite so many sufferings, it goes through and still it never expects that it would be watered or given care.

17. I got some clarity. I said that if the plant starts getting into expectations, nobody would get fruits and shadow.

18. S asked if this stopped, then what would happen to the World?

19. I said the entire ecosystem world get disturbed.

20. S then smiled and again asked as to what suffering meant for me now?

21. Now my thoughts were changed. 

22. I said that sufferings were my notions, the way I reacted to the actions and conveyed the resultant feelings to my soul.

23. S asked as to how I would want to change it now.

*24. I replied that I would look at these as learnings and improvise my thoughts. I was reacting earlier and I now I would act instead of reacting.*

25. S now hugged me and said that I had got the real gist now.

26. Then S asked me as to how I united my soul with the Almighty?

27. I said that God is within my soul. I just think of the unending light that comes from Him and all darkness goes away.

28. S smiled and said that now I was good to move on as I had got the key to stay contented.

29. Life is all about experiences and learnings. 

30. What we perceive could be a thought for us. However, it needs to be analysed from different angles with impact purview.

31. Do things in the spirit of Eternal love and dedicate yourself to that Super power which controls and manages the Trinity.

32. Live life to the fullest and the best. Every moment is precious, a day is too long and time is Eternal!!!

04/04/23, 10:48 - Anuj Gupta: Thought for today!

1. I was doing self introspection and retrospection.

2. I had certain thoughts accumulated in my mind. 

3. I was wondering as to what is the essence of life? What is it that is foremost important to have a contented and enriched life?

4. 
Money?
Influence?
Fame?
Power?
Prosperity?
Devotion?

5. Can money buy everything in this world. If yes, then why do  we still suffer?

6. Other factors- they compliment us but still the equation remains incomplete.

7. I agree that everyone has a different perception. What appears as M to someone, appears as W to the other. After all everyone is different😐.

8. Contentment is a state of mind. What we perceive is what we infer and inference is someone’s own intellect!

9. I think that we all have a predefined mind set which is quite judgemental and has a tendency to do the things the way we want them to be.

10. So, the points that are mentioned above are considered and assessed differently by all and it is a mix in every situation.

11. What we need to understand is as to what we want to accomplish in life, how we want to go ahead, what is our methodology to carve out our action plan, how we want to create a difference in positive aspects and how the value is generated in all facets of life?🤔

12. We all start our day with plans, make schedules, do our work and get results. 

13. Do we ever do a SWOT analysis of what all we did in  the day (Strength, Weekness, Opportunities and Threat)?

14. We follow our beliefs, we admire our principles, we strongly support our decisiveness. 

15. However, do we ever analyse the degree of contentment that we got at the closing of the day. Or we were simply counting our bank balances 😇😇

16. How did our actions and reactions make a difference. Did we create a thought for someone that we brought positivity?

17. There are lessons and teachings that we get from our Principals and Principles (try to understand these words and their gist here) and what we tend to give others to follow.

18. In reality, have we ever understood the gist of these ourselves and applied them in reality to our lives. If yes, have we measured the resultant?

19. Things need to be simplified. 

20. 1+1=2 . Why do we tend to create our own equations and complicate the thoughts?

21. Why do we tend to portray ourselves to be perfectionists when we donot have clear answers to very basis questions?

22. Contentment comes from one simple belief which is simplistic and honest way of doing things. 

23. We need to come out of our shells that we have created and hided ourselves in these.

24. We portray what we are not and what we are, we ourselves forget at times!

25. Think through and get enriched and contented!

04/04/23, 15:20 - Mommy: Yes
04/04/23, 15:27 - Anuj Gupta: You need to understand that these people are only interested in increasing their group size and make the people follow them and do as what they want. They were quite successful in moulding you but could not influence me.

You were only and only a vendor for them who gave you education services which abundantly available in market.

07/04/23, 14:54 - Anuj Gupta: Thought for today!

1. I have been thinking about this subject at times and a lot of thoughts come up. 

2. We talk about being rich or poor or middle class at times. What exactly do these mean from the perspective of one's perception?

3. First of all, we need to define what it means by being rich? Is this referring to someone's bank balance, or the property that one has had or the business turnover or what is it?

4. In majority, it drills down to money. So, is money everything that one can vouch for or is this something much beyond?

5. Look, there are three entities: Necessities, Comforts and Luxuries!

6. Majority of the people around us work to fulfill their necessities. It takes years for a person to move from making 10,000 to 100,000 a month. 

7. So, if we ask a person from the lower range, they would not even bother to differentiate these three. They would have had their own ways of enjoying life.  

8. Ask a person from the higher band. They would still contemplate deciding if their daily expenses are met. Reason, higher the inflow, the more is the need to spend. 

9. A person with more money will tend to have a bigger need to save than a person with lesser money many times. 

10. So, where is the Math and how is this done?

11. So, it gets difficult to understand how we define Wealthy (state of being rich).

12. Somebody once told me. Earning is important. Spending is the requirement. However, when to spend, how much to spend and where to spend - these are very important and most of us do not have clarity on managing it. We just tend to run after the numbers.

13. Life is full of colors and experiences. 

14. Savings are earnings. Earnings need to be saved.

15. I think from where I look at it, it is more important to have a qualitative perspective on this than being quantitative.

16. Go for quality in life. Segregate the things among Good, Better and the Best. 

17. Look for the best. Do not compromise. 

18. Anything which appears costly may not be worthy every time. At the same time, something which is not expensive may not be inferior in quality. We need to have a clear thought on this.

19. We need to understand and recognize the difference between glass and diamond. Both look transparent.

20. However, glass is fragile and breaks while diamond is strong and the whole world knows its strength and the worth.

21. State of being rich or poor does not teach this difference. It is your intellect. Utilize it to the fullest and the best.

22. We do not get richer by what we have earned or saved. 

23. Rather, we become rich by virtue of how we have helped people with us to become rich. 

24. Greatness does not come by doing great things. Understand what it means. Greatness is accomplished by making the things around us great. This is the gist of life and very important to understand.

25. 
*Necessities for someone might be comforts for another person. 

*Comfort for someone might be the basic requirement for someone. 

*Something which could be a luxury for a person could be the need for another person. 

*Something which is a basic need for someone could be a luxury for another person. 

26. Read these lines again and again and understand what these mean. These define the entire life.

27. We become rich by our deeds, our acheivements, value generation and by how much we diminish the sufferings of the human mankind. 

28. To have lot of thoughts is not important. 

29. What is important is that we think through and get the value out of those thoughts and implement in life with one view - how to generate value which helps to make life easier and better for someone.

30. Define your Circle of Influence. Do we know what it means?

*Inner circle - We and our families.
*Outer circle - People around us and the whole world.

31. Need to generate value for the ecosystem. That is the core! 

32. Fill your mind with great thoughts. Have a great day!

09/04/23, 15:19 - Anuj Gupta: एक पहलवान जैसा, हट्टा-कट्टा, लंबा-चौड़ा व्यक्ति सामान लेकर किसी स्टेशन पर उतरा। उसनेँ एक टैक्सी वाले से कहा कि मुझे साईँ बाबा के मंदिर जाना है।

टैक्सी वाले नेँ कहा- 200 रुपये लगेँगे। उस पहलवान आदमी नेँ बुद्दिमानी दिखाते हुए कहा- इतने पास के दो सौ रुपये, आप टैक्सी वाले तो लूट रहे हो। मैँ अपना सामान खुद ही उठा कर चला जाऊँगा।

वह व्यक्ति काफी दूर तक सामान लेकर चलता रहा। कुछ देर बाद पुन: उसे वही टैक्सी वाला दिखा, अब उस आदमी ने फिर टैक्सी वाले से पूछा – भैया अब तो मैने आधा से ज्यादा दुरी तर कर ली है तो अब आप कितना रुपये लेँगे?

टैक्सी वाले नेँ जवाब दिया- 400 रुपये।

उस आदमी नेँ फिर कहा- पहले दो सौ रुपये, अब चार सौ रुपये, ऐसा क्योँ।

टैक्सी वाले नेँ जवाब दिया- महोदय, इतनी देर से आप साईँ मंदिर की विपरीत दिशा मेँ दौड़ लगा रहे हैँ जबकि साईँ मँदिर तो दुसरी तरफ है।

उस पहलवान व्यक्ति नेँ कुछ भी नहीँ कहा और चुपचाप टैक्सी मेँ बैठ गया।

इसी तरह जिँदगी के कई मुकाम मेँ हम किसी चीज को बिना गंभीरता से सोचे सीधे काम शुरु कर देते हैँ, और फिर अपनी मेहनत और समय को बर्बाद कर उस काम को आधा ही करके छोड़ देते हैँ। किसी भी काम को हाथ मेँ लेनेँ से पहले पुरी तरह सोच विचार लेवेँ कि क्या जो आप कर रहे हैँ वो आपके लक्ष्य का हिस्सा है कि नहीँ।

हमेशा एक बात याद रखेँ कि दिशा सही होनेँ पर ही मेहनत पूरा रंग लाती है और यदि दिशा ही गलत हो तो आप कितनी भी मेहनत का कोई लाभ नहीं मिल पायेगा। इसीलिए दिशा तय करेँ और आगे बढ़ेँ कामयाबी आपके हाथ जरुर थामेगी।

16/04/23, 11:34 - Kshitij Gupta: Dear Dr. Banerjee,

I am writing to seek your medical advice regarding some symptoms that have been troubling me lately. Specifically, I have been experiencing persistent coughing, a runny nose, frequent sneezing, and discomfort in the nostrils and eye area when my nose is blocked. Given that there is a family history of allergic sinusitis and allopathic doctors have confirmed this diagnosis for me, I am concerned about the cause of these symptoms. In addition, I have noticed that eating anything cold deteriorates my condition, resulting in a runny nose and sore throat. 
Additionally, I have been facing difficulty in breathing and suffering from a constant dry cough for the past few days. Also, I have been experiencing constant coughing every night while sleeping, which is causing me to wake up frequently. I suspect that this is due to my dust and pollen allergies, which have been problematic for me in the past.

I would greatly appreciate your guidance on the next steps to take in addressing my symptoms. Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Best regards,
Kshitij Gupta

01/05/23, 20:41 - Anuj Gupta: *Thought for today!*

1. I have had a thought about this subject of one's fitment in a system!

2. Let us get into the depths of this. I think as and when a person thinks of one's personality and traits, one thing that definitely comes in his mind as to how one fits among the people around.

3. Every individual is different - different personality, different thoughts, different qualities, different deltas, different perceptions and different goals in life. 

4. The point that I want to emphasize is that one should know about what kind of society, what kind of circle, what kind of place and various other factors ; one can fit in.

5. How is this relevant to one's success in life, one's prosperity and one's way to live a soulful, peaceful and contented life?

6. Humans are social beings. To live alone is difficult and we all need to be among people. However, everyone walks alone at some or the other time.

7. I think everyone needs to be clear about one's interests. One needs to understand what kind of people would understand one, value one and vice versa. If this is clear then the association generates value for everyone.

8. To be educated does not mean as to how qualified one is. What it means is how well one can understand the situations, the subjects and have a wise and intelligent thinking about addressing these.

9. The more experience one gains, one should learn to have a better analysis of subjects , better methodology to handle these and then yield better results.

10. However, one needs to be surrounded by people whom one understands and who understands one. 

11. Look, one doesn't buy everything which is costly and at the same time, everything which is costly may not be worth buying.

12. We can buy anything that is not costly but everything which does not have a high cost may not be worth considering too.

13. Everyone cannot be friends but at the same time, one cannot go and find friends everywhere.

14. If one keeps looking for perfect people in this world, one would be left alone. 

15. However, at the same time, one needs to have perfect people from the perspective of fitting in one's kind of ecosystem. 

16. So, one has to be selective and intelligent. Respect everyone's thoughts!

17. So what is the message? 

18. Anyone and everyone:
Realize your inner self
Understand your goals of life
Revisit your values
Respect your thoughts 
19. Then look for friends who understand you and walk along on longer paths. 

20. A mutually respectful association which generates positivity and makes life more contented and happy!

14/05/23, 10:10 - Anuj Gupta: Hi Dear,
Good Day!

We are not averse to the touring excursion to Gujarat and neither have anything contrary to mingle with the group.

It is just that this weather is very hot and the kids are not willing to go to plains in this season. So the time is not right.

We are instead planning a holiday at some hill station.

So we would request you to cancel our tickets.

I would want to take this opportunity to put up my candidacy for the post of Head - Girl.

If given a chance, I would work to improve the parents teachers communication and increase transparency in the state of school affairs.

I would ensure that there are regular practices suggested to the school management which can help to increase the exposure of students to learn about the business world. 

Such activities may be regular visits to industry, read case studies and also attend lectures may be remotely or through visits of experienced professors in the school.

I would also suggest to the management to share with parents from time to time about the latest regulations and amendments made by the education ministry. 

I would form a student association where students will put up their points which need improvement and also share best practices which can lead to better results if adopted by other students.

I would also inculcate the idea of following balanced life style encompassing Yoga and enriched diet plan for the students as well as the families. 

Overall, I would try to lead by examples and help the students by generating awareness as to how to lead a healthy and prosperous life with simplicity.
08/07/23, 13:19 - Anuj Gupta: Thought of the Day!

Life gives experiences. At times in life , we come across situations which are unpredictable. We don't understand as to what to decide and what is right? One thought that comes to mind is that at times, the power of a good soul is very strong and has the ability to understand the right step to be taken and take the appropriate path. 

The biggest question that comes up is as how to understand the situation which puts one to get into a space where he loses the intellectual decision making power. What is it? Fear is the biggest factor. Messages that the brain sends us are basically according to what we are thinking and our entire system starts functioning that way. If you feel scared that something may happen to you, you immediately develop that fear and then your brain starts showing you those symptoms. Over and excessive thinking is sin.

Now what is the way to handle these?

If you do not have the capability, then listen to what the other is saying. believe him and follow. Some people are born leaders and have the capability to analyse the situation and address it. They are not scared.

You know what the gist is. We all talk about a lot of things in life. We talk of success, failures, achievements, goals and big fundamentals. How many of us make our lives simple? How many look at the reality of life . Do we have the capability to pre-sense the situations and handle them?

Those few exceptional people are the ones who have that divine power in them which connects them every time to that superpower which controls this Universe. They actually have that energy which fills their and everyone's life with positivity and life. Gist is to adore them and admire them.

Question is as to how we can become like them. My answer is we cannot. They are born like this. They did not work to make them like this. All was inherited from the Super Power. Admire them, adore them, follow them and above all, learn from their actions and try to inculcate in ourselves.
